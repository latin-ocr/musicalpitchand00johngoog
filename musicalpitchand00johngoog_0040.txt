tinuous sounds are those in which the regions (τόποι) of the
changes (in pitch) iu each direction are not manifest, or in
which no part whatever is ἰσότονος fora perceptible interval
‘ (of time). The same sort of thing is seen in the case of the
colors of the rainbow. Of such a nature are those sonnds
which sound at the same timeas their pitch is being raised or
lowered, even while this change is being produced.'' The
lowing of cattle and the howling of wolves are given as
examples of these continuone sounds. Porphyry1 adds the
attempts of the beginuer at singing, who cannot atrike the
right pitch at first, but feels for it.² He also gives asan

instance the tuning of stringed instruments. All such ‘ oon-
tinuous’ sounds are unfit for music.

Ptolemy's second class, ‘discrete’ sounds-drdooa (ἀνισό-
τονοι) διωρισμένοι-οε defines as sounds “in which the
regions of the changes (in pitch) are manifest.'’ The spaces

or pitch-distances traversed are measurable‚ or such sounds
arise when their parts remain ‘equitonic' for a perceptible
interval of time. As a parallel he gives the juxtaposition of
pure and unmixed colors. Sonnds like these are suitable for
music, because they are bounded by ἰσότονοι ψόφοι and may
be measured by their excesses (ὑπεροχοί), that is, by their
ratios

Continuons sounds are, then, sounds in which the variation
in pitch takes place in such a way that it advances by insen·
sible gradations and that it has no defined limits. Discrete
sounds are those in which the pitch moves over well-defined
distances The two classes are characterized precisely by the

two kinds of κίνησις explained by Aristoxenus-the continu· ·
