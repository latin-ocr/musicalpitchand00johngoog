ous and the discrete or intervallate. And just as these two
motions are appropriate to speech and song respectively, so
ψόφοι συνεχεῖς, having no unity (Ptol, Herm„ 1. iv„ p. 8

Wallisz μηδαμῆ μηθὲν ὑποβάλλοντες ἓν καὶ ταύτό), are un-
suitable lor music, while ψόφοι διωρισμένοι ονε suitable, and
are now, alter the definitions have been completed, called by
Ptolemy φθόγγοι libid„ p. 9: καὶ δὴ φθόγγους ἤδη καλοῖμεν
ἂν τοὺς τοιούτους, ότι φθόγγος ἐστὶ ψόφος ἕνα καὶ τόν αὐτὸν
ἐπέχων τόνον).

But if discrete sounds are φθόγγοι and keep the same pitch,
why are they classed by Ptolemy with ψόφοι ιἰνισότονοι rather
than with ι’σότουοιὶ) It is evident that discrete sounds may
be analyzed into ο εενίεο of ι’σότονοι. They are ἀνισότονοι
only with reference to one another ; each regarded by itself is
ἰσότουος. It would seem that Ptolemy had in mind large masses
or groups of sounds. Asan example of ψόφοι ι’σότουοι he might
have given the tones of such instruments as can produce only
one note, like certain whistles and horne ον the cymbals. The
difficulty arises from attempting to regard as a unit too great
a body of sound, too long a period of time. It is best to
analyne such sounds as the tones ofa fiute into ο serios of
separate sounds. This Ptolomy does not seem to have done.
Wishing to include in his olassifioation his ψόφοι ιἰνισότονοι
συνεχεῖς, and being unable to choose a simple unit from the
mass of wavering sound, he seems to have been led to include
among the ἀνισότουοι sounds which differed from the above
as singing differs from speaking. In this way the old Aris·
toxenean treatment of κίνησις φωνῆς erops out.¹

If now wo compare Ptolemy's classification of sounds with
Aristides' classification of the kinds of κίνησις φωνῆς (εεε the
tables on pp. 23¹ and 24³), it will be observed that the same

¹The two uses (see p. 24¹) of the words ῖσότονος and ἂνισότονοε are thus
in danger of losing their distinction of meaning, if it is permitted to regnrd
a number of sounds as one. In the term suggested by Porphyry, ομιιομερής
(and ἂνομοιομερής, thread), the μέρη are better regarded aa separate soundn-
