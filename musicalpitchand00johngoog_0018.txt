not a bad substitute for the spoken word. But in the case of
music there is no clement which we can separate, or imagine
to he separated, from the sounds themselves, without destroy-
ing the very nature of the music. While rhythm is, perhaps,
aster the sounds, a‘. a, the pitch clement in sounds, the most
important constituent, rhythm alone is not music.

In what condition, then, is the study of ancient classical
music with regard to our ability to reproduce the actual
sounds? What are thc steps which we must take in order
to obtain a correct interpretation of the music of the Greeks?

From one point of view musical sounds may be regarded ’
as endowed with two dimensione. One of these is pitch; the
other is time. Every sound in a melody differs from every
other sound, either in one of these dimensions or in both 3
and every sound is defined, or at least is defined in every
particular oeseutial to constituting the melody, by giving the
pitch of each note and its time-clement in the two respecta oi
the position in time and the duration in time. The time-
codrdinates and the pitch-coordinates together constitute the
melody. As a result, melody can be represented graphically
on a plane, and this is what is done in a rough way hythe
ordinary staff notation by means of the position of the notas
oa the staff (modified hythe hey-signatura and the ‘acci-
dental' sharps and flate), and by their position oloap the staff
(as determined by the bars and modified by differenoes in
their appearance to give their duration).

There are, to be sure, other ways in which musical notes
may differ from one another. In addition to differenoes of
pitch and of duration, we may have differences of ‘timbre'
or ‘quality,' and differenoes in the loudness or ‘ force' with

which the notes are sounded. But the quality and the force
may be varied without destroying the nature of a melody,
whereas alterations in the pitches of the notes which forma
tune, and in their duration·valucs‚ cannot, in general, be made
without altering the melody. It is only when the changes of
pitch or of duration are uniform throughout a pieoe of music
