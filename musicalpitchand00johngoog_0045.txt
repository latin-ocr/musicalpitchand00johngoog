sound apart from its connection with other musical sounds.
The terme ἐμμελής and ἐκμελής, used both of notes them·
selves and of the intervals formed by the notes, signify that
they are usable or unusable in the same piace of music. One
note is ε’κμελής with regard to another note, if the interval
between them is not one which can oocur in actual musio,
although it might be used in speech. For example, a note
which should divide the interval of a semitono into two small
intervals would be ἐκμελής in modern European music.
Ptolemy divides φθόγγοι into the two classes oi ἐμμελεῖς and
οἱ ἐκμελεῖς.

Ptolemy,Horm., 1. iv., p. 9Wallis: εἰσὶ δέ ἐμμελεῖς μὲν
ὅσοι συναπτόμεναι πρὸς ἀλλήλους εὔφωνοι (or εὕφοροι) τνιγχά-
νονσι πρὸς ἀκοήν. ἐκμελεῖς δὲ ὅσοι μὴ οὕτως ἔχουσι. Com-
pare Porphyry, οοννοοηιαιῖιιι, p. 265 Wallis, and p. 215.

Gaudentius, alter speaking of the two kinds of φωνή, the
συνεχής and the διαστηματική, says (dorm. iutrod„ 1, p. 2
Meib. (p. 328 ΚΝ. J )) ἰδίως δέ τῆς διαστηματικῆς τὸ μὲν
ἐμμελές, τὸ δὲ ἐκμελές· τὸ μέν ῥητοῖς χρώμενον διαστήμασι
καὶ μηδὲν ἀπολειπόμενον ἢ ὑπερβάλλον αὐτὸ ἐμμελές, τὸ δέ
ἐνδεὲς η ὑπερβάλλον μικρῷ τῶν ὡρισμένων διαστημάτων
ἐκμελές. And further on (ibid, 3, p. 4 Meib. (p. 330,11K.
v. J )) r τῶν δὲ διαστημάτων τὰ μέν ἐστιν ἐμμελῆ, τὰ δ’ ἐκμελῆ.
τῶνδ’ ἐμμελῶν τὰ μὲν σύμφωνα, τὰ δέ ἀσύμφωνα, κτέ.

These terms are then more appropriately applied to the
intervals than to the notes, for it is evident that every oon·
oeivable degree of pitoh ean be used in melody if the hey-note
be suitably pitohed.¹

The term ἐμμελής is also used in nearly the same sense as
διαστηματικός as opposed to συνεχής (see above, p. 18).

¹It should be observed that sometimes only those φθόγγοι ἐμμελεῖς which
are not consonant are included under the term. This narrower use is found
in Ptolemy’s Harmonice, 1. vii, p. 15 Wallis, where ἀνισότονοι καὶ διωρισμένοι

φθόγγοι aro either ὁμόφωνοι or σύμφωνοι (two kinds of consonance arc here
distinguished) or ἐμμελεῖς.
