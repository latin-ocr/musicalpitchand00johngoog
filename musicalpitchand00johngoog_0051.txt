ἐμμελῆ)ι is very small compared with the number of inter·
vals possible,² it does not seem unreaaonable to hope that one
or other of them, or some aliquot part, may serve our purpose.

Suppose, now, that we represent pitch bya straight line,
and that equal distances on the line stand for equal intervals,
wherever taken. If then we arbitrarily ehoose a certain
length on the line to represent any given interval, such aa ¹the
Octave,³.it will, of course, be possible to find distances which
will accurately represent all other intervals. The sum of two
such dbtanoes will then represent the sum of the two corre-
sponding intervals, obtained by making the acute note of one
of them coincide with the grave note of the other. In like
manner the arithmetioal differenoe of any two distances will
represent the differenoe of the corresponding intervals, obtained
by making the two acute notes or the two grave notes coincide.

’Compare Sedley Taylor, stata Sicpinp, dl 11, 12, where it is stated that
within the compass of an average voice, two or three hundred different ’
degrees of pitch are distinguishable. If the compass of such a voice is taken
to be an octave and a fifth (cp. eit. ἓ 74), only twenty of these different pitches
are found on our keyed instrumente, where temperament prevaila. This
number is considerably increaaed in practice, when temperament is ignored‚
aa in singing end violin music, but even then the number of notes to the
octave is comparatively small. It must be rememhered that in those corn·
putatione in which it is found that a perfect keyed instrument would have
to have twenty-five or more keys within each octave, many of these notes
are incompatible (so to speak) with one another (ἐκμελεῖς). Belonging to ·
remotely related keys, they do not occur in one and the same pieee of music,
and are often so close aa to be almost indistinguishable in pitch. Itis
equally true of Greek music, that, althougha large number of notes within
each octave was recognized, they were not all of them usable in the same
pieca of musio. Aristoxenus (Hunc, p. 28 Meih.) is our authority for the
statement that the voice cannot advance by quarter·tones beyond the second
step. The number of notes used at one time was never many more than
eight within the octove.

³Following the example of Mr. A. J. Ellis in his translation of Helm-
holtz’s &metiens os Torta, and. Eng. ed, 1885, the names of intonata will
hereafter be written with capital initial letters, as Fifth, Major-third,
Semitone.
