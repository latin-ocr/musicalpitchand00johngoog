(3) that which is bounded or awompaeaed by two sounds
not of the same pitch (Aristoxenus, Plutarch, Cleonides, Gau-
dentius, Bryennius); or a region or space (τόπος) receptiva of
sounds intermediate in pitch to the bounding sounds (Aris-
toxenus, Bryennius) ; or a vocal magnitude defined or bounded
by two sounds (Bryennius).

(4) a passage (ὁδός or μετάβασις) from acute to grave or
cicc cersct or from one pitch to another (Nicomachus, Cleonides,
Bryennius).

Dismissing definition (1) because it is too vagus, we may
notice that the definitions in group (2) merely express the fact
that it is a pitch-differcnce on which the relationship depends,
but do not imply that there is sucha thing as difference in the
aize of intervals and that measurement is possible. The differ-
ence of pitches might be like a difference in color, crin odora
. or tastcs. In the definitione numbered (3) the idea of a space
or distance is clearly brought out, and in (4) the noticn of
movement from one bound to the other is included. Both (3)
and (4) imply more or less clearly the infinite subdivisibility
of pitch. This is very plain in the definition that an interval
is a space receptiva of intermediate pitches, for an intermedi-
ate pitch would form two new smaller intervals, which would
themselves also be divisible into yet smaller intervals. In( ),
and to a certain extent also in (3), κίνησις συνεχής seems to
lie at the bottom of the conception of an interval. Without
this idea of a gradual passage from one pitch to another, it is
hard to see how change of pitch could be regarded as a passage
at all. If the pitch changes suddenly, in the way indicated
by κίνησις διαστηματική, the sensation does not suggest a
transition or transference so much as a transformation. The
effect is similar to that produced by a sudden change in color.
Intermediate shades cf color are not present to the mind.

The continuous nature of pitch would naturally be one of
the earliest points to be observed. But, although it would
readily be admitted that to all intents and purposes pitch
seemed tc be a continuous quantity and not a discrete quan-
