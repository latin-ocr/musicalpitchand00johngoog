ὀγδοάδος) ; and that it is the product of two squares (4 >< 9=
36) and the sum of three cubes (1 -l- 8 l· 27 =36). Moreover
it forms two parallelograms, one 3 byl2, the other 4 by 9.
If now (1018 D) we take 6 (the side of the square) and 8 (the
side of the triangle) and 9 and 12 (sides of the two parallelo·
grams), we have in these numbers the ratios of the consonances.

There are a number of passages in the following chapters
of the de animae procreatione in which the consonant ratios
are given, but they are not important enough to be quoted,
being for the most part but repetitions of former statements.
But a few words should be said in regard to the two dissonant
intervals, the Tone and the Leimma, which are closely oon-
nected with the consonances. We have already remarked
(p. 46) that the Tone (i. a, the Major Whole-tone, ratio 8 :9)
owes its prominence largely to the fact that it is the difference
in width of¹ the Fisth and the Fourth3 and the Leimma is
important in the formation of certain scales (for example, the
scales in the Timaeus), owing to the fact that it is the interval
which must be added to two and to three Tones to make the
Fourth and the Fisth respectively.

The Pythagoreans associated two numbers with these inter·
vals, 13 with the Leimma,l and 27 with the Tone. It is easily
seen that these numbers express approximately the relative aize
of the intervals, for the Fourth is a little less than two Tones and
ahalf, so that the Leimma isa little less than an exact Semitone.
The method of obtaining these numbers will now be given.

In regard to the Leimma, the number is derived directly
from the ratio 243 ε 256 (which we obtain by dividing the ratio
of the Fourth by that of the Ditone‚ or Pythagorean Third

(= two Tones), as follows: 4 , 9² )‚ and is

nothing more nor less than the arithmetical difference between
the two terms. ,

It is, of course, illogical to identify an interval with the
absolute differenoe of two numbers which express its ratic.
