After commenting on the wonderful properties of the
Pythagorean tetraotys‚ the number 36,1 the author olaims for
the quaternion in question, oalled the Platonis tetraotys, an
even higher degree of perfectiora. The plan on which the
quaternion is construoted is then set forth and the advantage Ι
of the Lambda-like arrangement is seen to bs that like
powers of 2 and 3 are conveniently plaoed for being added
and multiplied together. In chapter 12 they are added:
2÷3=5; 4t9=133 8†27=35; andthesignificanoe
of these numbers is stated in the following words (Plut, de
anim. proca, o. 12, 1017 F): τούτων γάρ τῶν ἀριθμῶν οἱ
Πυθαγορικοὶ τὰ μὲν ε’ τροφόν, ὅπερ ε’στὶ φθόγγον, ἐκάλουν,
οἰόμενοι τῶν τοῦ τόνου διαστημάτων πρῶτον εἶναι φθεγκτὸν
τὸ πέμπτον· τὰ δὲ τρισκαίδεκα λεῖμμα, καθάπερ Πλάτων,
τὴν εἰς ’ίσα τοῦ τόνου διανομὴν ἀπογιγνώσκοντες· τά δὲ πέντε
καὶ τριάκοντα άρμονίαν, ὅτι συνέστηκεν ἐκ δυεῖν κύβων
πρώτων ἀπ’ ἀρτίου καὶ περιττοῦ γεγονότων, ἐκ τεσσάρων δ’
ἀριθμῶν, τοῦ ς’ καὶ τοῦ η’ καὶ τοῦ θ’ καὶ ιβ ’, τὴν ἀριθμητικὴν
καὶ τὴν ἁρμονικὴν ἀναλογίαν περιεχόντων.

Nothing more is said at this plaoe of 5, the τροφόν, and 13,
the λεῖμμα,2 but the nature of the ἁρμονία, 35, is illustrated
by means of a diagram. A rectangle is construoted whose

sides are to one another in length as 5 to 7. The area will
then be 35. The author then divides the reetangle into four ς
oompartments by drawing two linea, one perpendicular to the

shorter sides and dividing them eaoh into two parts with „
lengths 2 and 3, and the other perpendicular to the longer

sides and dividing them into parts with lengths 3 and 4.

¹The sum of the first four even numbers and the first four odd numbers
isto: 1÷3÷5÷7=16
2÷4÷6÷8=2o

Every odd number with the following even number forms a syzygy. The
fourth syzygy, 7 and 8, is the first to form a square (6²=36), whether
alonem, as in the present ease, added to the sum of its predecessore.

’The τροφόν will be discussed at p. 62, ιο, the λεῖμμα at p. 57, sq.
