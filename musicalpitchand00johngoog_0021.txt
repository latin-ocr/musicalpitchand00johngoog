corresponding intervals in connection with their occurrence in
actual melody and in the ancient scales. The subject is the
measurement of intervals abstractly considered, irrespeotive cf
their place in the scale and irrespective of their fonction in
actual representation. Pitch is consequently considered, not
as a quality or property of musical sounds, but as a quantity,
which may be measured like any other quantity. And in its
measurement we are not concerned so much with the absolute
position of notes on the scale of acuteness and graveness, as
with their relative position. Since pitch lengths can be meas-
ured only when the bounds are rigidly fixed, a discussion of
the musical sound will precede, involving a few words on the
classification of sounds and the place therein of musical sounds
and on the ancient conception of pitoh. ⁵

The ancient explanatione of sound as a physical phenome·
non, however insufficient from a modern point of view, are
accurate enough in general for musical purposes The im-
portant part played by the air, either as the cause of sound or
as the medium cf its transmission to our ears, seems to have
been very universally recognized. Plato¹ defines sound asa
“stroke transmitted through the ears by the air and passed
through the brain and the blood to the soul.'' That a blow
is necessary for the production of a sound seems to have been
brought out before the time of Archytae, for Archytas approves
of this doctrine of his predecessore in a passage quoted by
Porphyry in his commentarius ad Ptolemaeum, p. 236 Wallis
(Wallis, Opera Mathematice, 111. p. 236).² But, according
