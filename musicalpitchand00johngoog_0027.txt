this, the usual definition, is open to criticism in the following
particulare. ln the first place, it excludes from the category
of musical sounds that union or binding of two notes known
as portamento, which the violin class cf instrumente and the
voice are capable of producing 3 for portamento must evidently
be defined as a gradual change of pitch between fixed limite.

In the second place, it admits such sounds as the tcnes cf
badly made bells, in which the pitch, such as it is, may remain
constant and steady, but which it is best tc class with non-
musical sounds. Lastly‚ before the steadiness or the unsteadi·
ness of the pitch of a sound is made the basis for a classification,
would it not be better to select the actual presence or absence of
pitch in the composition of the sound‘l To be sure, this would
⁴ not enable us to draw a hard and fast line, owing to the fact
that pitch may be present in varying quantities, but at least
we could separate those sounds in which it is impossible to
recognize any trace cf pitch from those in which it is present
>to some extent, those scunds which are purely noisy from
those which are to a certain extent musical. After that the
steadiness or unsteadiness of the pitch could be used in malr-
ing a subdivisiones pitch·sonnds‚ in which the sub-class of
sounds of steady pitch would correspond to the class of musi-
cal sounds as commonly defined.

But there still remains the twcfold objection that the pecu-
liar variation in pitch above mentioned (portamento) is classed
with ‘non-musical' sounds‚ although it is distinctly musical,
and that such sounds as the tones of badly cast bells, whose
pitch is occasionally steady, are classed with musical sounds,
although they are essentially noisy. ’

to which coiea is due is irregular and flitfing, alternately fast and slow, and
creating in the mind a bewildering and confusing effect of a more or less

. unpleasant character. Noise may also bc produced by combining in an

arbitrary manner several musical notes, as when one leans with the fore·
arm against the heys of apiano. In fact, the composition cf regular periodic
motione, thus effected, is equivalent to an irregular motion.”
