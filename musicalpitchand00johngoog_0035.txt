have only ιο point to the fact that their written acoentsexpress
this rise and fall in pitch. It was natural then that a com-
parison should be instituted between the formal melody of
vocal music and that more subtle melody which existe in con-
versational speech. Ιι is also important to remember that the
voice held a predominant position in Greek music, possibly
due quite as much ιο the inferiority of the musical instrumente
of the ancients as to any greater appreciation of the capabili-
ties of the voice on their part.

Aristoxenus is now ready ιο describe the φθόγγος (musical
sound), having prepared the way for it by his discussion of the
two sorts of κίνησις. He says (Horra, 1. ἓ 31, p. 12 Meib.):
κινεῖται μὲν γὰρ (ἡ φωνὴ) ἐν τῷ διάστημά τι ποιεῖν, ἵσταται
δ’ e'v τῷ φθόγγῳ. The stopping places of κίνησις διοστηματική
are φθόγγοι. Αι p. 15 Meib. there is a different definition

, (see below, p. 27).

We have noticed (p. 18) that the ‘continuous movement'
of the voice, as described by Aristoxenus, does not includes
gradual change of pitch, if bounded by fixed degrees of pitch.
The treatment may be said to be faulty to that extent. In
fact, the differenoe between the two kinds ol motion, when
analyzed, turns out to be more a difference of steadiness and
unsteadiness in pitch than simply a difference in the manner
in which it may change from acute to grave and cicc card.
In κίνησις συνεχής the pitch is nowhere steady and is always
varying; in κίνησις διαστηματική it is steady now atthis
height, now at that, and never varies except by leaps. The
sounds which constitute the former are then ιο be found in
the class of sounds commonly styled ‘non-musical,' those
which constitute the latter, in the ‘musical' class.l

Although no provision is made for gradual change in pitch
bounded by fixed degrees of pitch-ina word, for portamento-
