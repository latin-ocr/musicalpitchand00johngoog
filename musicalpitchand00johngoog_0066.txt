the διὰ πέντε and διὰ τεσσάρων are 3 :2 and 423 respectively,
that the ratio of the διὰ πέντε καὶ διὰ πασῶν is 321, and
that the ratio of tho δὶς διὰ πασῶν is 421. Theorems 13-16

(16-19) deal with the διάστημα τονιαῖον or τόνος, ratio 928,
and show that the Octavo is less than six Tonas, and that the
Fourth is less than two Tonas and a Half-tone, and the Fifth
than three Tonas and a Half-tone. Theorem 16 shows that
the Tone oannot be divided into two equal parts.1 Since the
proof is based on the faot that a superparticular ratio oannot
be so divided, the same argument would show that the Fifth
and the Fourth and other intervals with superparticular ratios
are lihewise indivisible into equal parts.

The Aristotelian Probiana, even if they are not the work of
Aristotle, are thought to henot muoh later in date than his
time. The Nineteenth Section, entitled Ὅσα περὶ ἁρμονίαν,
contains a number of passages in whioh the interval ratios
are mentioned. See problema 23, 34, 35, 39 b, 41, and 50
(p. 90, sq. K. v. J an). The existenoe of the oonsonant ratios is
affirmed (XIX. 39 b: οῖ ἐν τῇ συμφωνία φθάηηοι λάηον ἔχουσι
κινήσεως πρὸς αὑτούς), and the ratios for the intervals of the
Octavo, Fifth‚ and Fourth are oorreotly given (352 διπλασία
ή νήτη τῆς ὑπάτης, oia ἡ νήτη δύο, ή ὑπάτη έν, καὶ οῖαή
ὑπάτη δύο, ἡ νήτη τέσσαρα, καὶ ἀεὶ οὕτως· τῆς δὲ μέσης
ἡμιολία. And 41: Διὰ τί δὶς μὲν δι’ ὀξειῶν ἢ δὶς διὰ τεττά-
ρων οὑ συμφωνεῖ, δὶς διὰ πασῶν δέ,·-Ἢ ὅτι τὸμὲν διὰ πέντε

τὸ δὲ διὰ πασῶν ἐπειδή ἐστιν ἐν διπλασίῳ λόγῳ, aad).

Problems 23 and 50 describe experiments which show the
ratios. Aristotle, Problema, m. 23 (p. 90 Κ. v. J) Διὰ τί
