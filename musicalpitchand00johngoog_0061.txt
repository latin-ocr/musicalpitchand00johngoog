of other intervals, consonant and dissonant, may have been
obtained either directly from the stringor indirectly by com-
bining the ratios already found. Thus the consonant intervals,
the Twelfth (Octave † Fifth) and the Double-octave, were
probably found to depend on the ratios 1 :3 and 124, respect-
ively. The Tone, which is the differencc in width between
the Fifth and the Fourth‚ was certainly regarded as dependent
on the ratio 829, but it is probable that this ratio was often
deduced from the ratios already obtained, and was not directly
observed from the lengths of string.

This fact, that the Tone is the difference of the two impor-
tant consonances, the Fifth and the Fourth, has given this
dissonant interval a prominent place in musical theory. In
consequence of being defined in this manner (as the differencs
of two consonant intervals), the Tone may bc tuned with the
same degree of precision that is obtainable in the case of the
consonant intervals. Dissonant intervals in general cannot
be tuned with any great accuracy. The Tone is thus closely ·
related to the consonances. Another fact has aided in giving
the Tone an importance not rightfully belonging to it. It is
that it differs from the sixth part of the Octave by onlya
minute interval. The ratio 8:9 taken six times (= 262,144:
531‚441) differs from the ratio 122 (= 262,144 : 524,288) by
a very small ratio. The corresponding small interval, called
the Pythagorean Comma, is only a little larger than the ordi-
nary Comma (802 81), an interval which is neglected in the
tuning of modern keyed instruments. For these two reasons
the Tone seemed to be well adapted for use as a unit of
measurement, and to have an especial quality. We are not,
therefore, surprised to find that the Tone is of frequent occur-
rence in scalea, as it is the only difference between intervals
which were recognized as consonant, which was not itself also
consonant. Its appearance in theoretical scales is natural ; tha
facility with which it may be tuned would undoubtedly causa
it also to appear in scales as actually tuned—for example, on
the lyra. But, if it is permittsdtodraw conclusions by analogy
