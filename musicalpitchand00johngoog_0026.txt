that those sounds which fall under the delinition of musical
sonnds form the hulk of the sounds which music employs.
There is no difficulty in grasping the general notion on
which the difference between musical and unmusical sonnds
rests. Everyone feels the differenoe which existe between
the speaking voice and the singing voice, between the sound
of a hoatman’s siren and the notes of a flute. ln most cases
it is easy to assign a sound to one or the other of these classes.
It will sometimes, however, be difficult to decide in the case
of certain complicated sonnds whether they have more the
character of musical notes or of noises. It then becomes
necessary to make a rigorous delinition of the musical sound,
in order to ascertain on what basis the classilication rests.
The delinition of musical and unmusical sonnds is usually
made to depend on the steadinass or unsteadinass of the pitch
of the sonnds. For example, Mr. Sedley Taylor defines these
sonnds in the following words :¹ “A musical sound is one of
coustant, a non-musical sound one of vuryinp, pitch.'' ² But

p. 48: “The differenoe, then, between musical and non-musical sounds
seems to lie in this, that the former are constant, while the latter are con-
tinually varying. The human voice can produce sonnds of both classes.
In singing a sustained note, it remains quite steady, neither rising nor fall-
ing. Its conversational tone, on the other hand, is perpetually varying in
height even within a single syllable; directly it cesses sc to vary, its non·
musical character disappears, and it becomes what is commonly called
‘sing-song! '' Ἴ

“ Besides the three qualities above mentioned [loudness pitch, and timbre],
there exists another point in which sonnds may be distinguished among
each other, and which, though perhaps reducible to difference of timbre,
requires some special remarks, via, that by which sounds are character·
