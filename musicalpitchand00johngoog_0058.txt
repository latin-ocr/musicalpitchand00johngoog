exercised. For in order that two stringe of equal length and
size shall produce sounds which form some given interval, it
is necessary to use weigbts which are to each other inversely

as the equares of the lengths of striugs of equal siue at the
same tension producing the same interval ; in other words,
the lengths vary inversely as the square-route of the weights.
The weigbts would not, therefore, give directly the ratios
desired. It is doubtful if the ancients could have obtained the
musical ratios from weights attached to stringe. Allowance
would also have to be made for the fact that the weight of
the string per linear unit is diminished by the tension.
Ptolemy appreciated the difficulties attending these methods
and discusses them in his Harmonice, 1. viii„ p. 17 Wallis.
The instrument on which the greatest relianoe was placed
for determining the ratios was the κανὼν μονόχορδος or ἁρμο-
νικός. Ptolemy describes it in the chapter cited above. It
consisted of a vibrating string stretchcd between two fixed
bridges‚ and passing over a third bridge, which could move
freely between the fixed bridges‚ and thus could be used to
divide the whole length of the string into two parts at any
desired point. The distance between the movable bridge and
the fixed bridges was measured on a scale which ran beneath
the string. By means of this instrument the ratios associated
with the various musical intervals could easily be calculated.
Conversely, if the movable bridge were placed at such a point
that the distance from one fixed bridge bore a certain ratio to
the length of the whole string, the interval corresponding to
tbe ratio could be produced. If the whole length of the string
were tuned to be in unison with the lowest note of the scale of
two Octaves, called the Perfect System, the proper distances
could be marked off for all tbe other notes. This operation
was called ἡ τοῦ κανόνος κατατομή. We have a description
of the method in which the string was divided toproduce this
scale in Theo Smyrnaeus, de munuc, o. 12 (pp. 57, 58 Hillo),
aud oc. 35, 36 (pp. 87-93 Hiller), where Thrasyllus is quoted
r'n catenam and in Euclid, sectio cunonis, ἐξ 19, 20 (p. 163, sq.
