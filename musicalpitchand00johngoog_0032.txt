einai φαμεν ἠρεμίαν φωνῆς, τὰς δ’ ἐν τοῖς ἔμπροσθεν εὕρομεν
οὔσας κινήσεις τινάς). Conversely στάσις (or ἑστάναι) is
defined by the help of τάσιςε δεῖδὲ καταμανθάνειν ὅτι τὸ μὲν
ἑστάναι τὴν φωνὴν τὸ μένειν ἐπὶ μιᾶς τάσεώς ἐστι (ἓ 32, p. 13
Metu). Of course, strictly speaking, what is defined in this
definition of τάσις is not so much ‘pitch' as ‘degree of pitch!

It is now necessary to compare some of the ancient classifi-
cations of sounds with those of modern theory, and soto
discus} the φθόγγος or ‘musical sound,' the unit of the scienoe
of musio. '

Aristoxenus set the example for a number of followers by
leading up to the definition of the musical sound through a
oareful analysis of what is termed κίνησις φωνῆς, the motion
of tte coice.1 He says that a description of the various kinds
of κίνησις is necessary for the proper definition of the pilippos?
In this description it will not be difficolt to see what sort of
a olassifioation of sounds Aristoxenus must be understood to
have had in mind. ¹

It is evident that the passage from one degree of pitch to
another must be made in one of two ways. Either the pitch
of a sound changes suddenly from the initial state to the final
state, in such a way that at no moment does the sound rest
at, or pass through, any intermediate degree of pitch3 or the
pitch changes gradually in the direction of the final degree
of pitch, that is, either upward or downward, and so pasees
through every possible intermediate degree, but rests at none.
These are the only two ways in which a sound emanating
from one and the same instrument can pass from one pitch to
another. They may be compared to stepping and gliding.
In the one case the intermediate space is leapt over, in the
other it is traversed.

'Aristoxenum Harmonice, 1. Ξ 4, p. 3 Meib.: καί τοι τούτου μὴ διορισθέντος
οὐ πάνυ ρφδιον εἰπεῖν περὶ φθόγγον τί τοτ’ ἐστίν.
