another is evidently at its maximum, except as it is lessened
by the restraining influenee of accompanying instrumente.

This enables us to reduce the number of interhals which
had a distinct and separate existence by merging into one all
those intervals which are so nearly of a size that we are
justified in regarding them as different aspecta of the same
phenomenon. But aster we have carried this process as far as
it is reasonable todo so, the number of intervals left is still
very great-far greater than we admit in modern theory.
Many of them are irreconcilably different in width. These
intervals, it would seem, must be accepted as having an inde-
pendent existence and as being necessary to the formation of
the scales of Greek music. But it is not necessary to assume
that they all existed in actual music at the same time. There
is still another possible cause for the differences in the sine of
intervals which must be considered in any attempt to appre-
ciate the scales of Greek music, and with it we bring our
discussion to a conclusion.

It is the liability to which dissonant intervals in particular,
if not alone, are subject of undergoinga gradual change in
their size with the development of the scale of which they are
a part. It must be borne in mind that homophonic or pure
melodic musicl does not demand a strict adherence to definite
degrees of pitch in the formationes its scales, and variation
in the width of the intervals is necessarily a result of this
freedom. In considering variatione due to the tuning we
assumed an ideal intonation for the interval which the best
authorities would recognize as a just intonation. In the case
of the variatione now under consideration there is no criterion
by which it is possible to select one width in preference to
another as a more perfect representative of the interval.
Fixed degrees of pitch come in with simultaneous harmony‚
of which we know that Greek music made little use. When
