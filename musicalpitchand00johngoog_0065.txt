case, even if thessales are purely numerical scales, they seem
to have been suggested by musical scales in actual use, and
may be illustrated and explained by supposing them to be
musical. We may safely see in the intervals between the
terme of the series references to the ratios associated with
musical intervals.

We have in Euclid's sectio emtouu¹ the earliest statement
in which the ratios² are explicitly given for the musical eon-
sonances. The first nine theorems (ten in MeibomiuS, Antiquae
Musicae Auctores Septem) are purely mathematical, dealing
with the natiue. In 10 (11 Meib.) the author proves that
the interval διὰ πασῶν is multiple; iu 11 (12) that the διὰ
τεσσάρων and tat πέντε are each superparticular; in 12 (13-
15) that the ratio of the διὰ πασῶν is 221, that the ratius of

'A sew words ought at this point to be said in explanationes the tech-
nieal terme used in the arithmetic of the Greeks for various sorte of ratius.
When the greater termes a ratio was compared with the lesser, and so
usually preceded it, the ratio was called πρόλογοςς when the lesser was
compared with the greater, the ratio was called ὑπόλογοο. There was
also a distinction of three kinds of ratius according as the antecedent was
greater than, was equal to, or was lese than, the consequent, as in Theo Smyr·
naeus, οοοοοοοο, ο. aa (ρ. 74 utrisq: πον st λόγον ον μιν aa μείζονες, οι ae “
ἑλόππονεο, οἱ steca. Equal ratius are those in which the terms are equal,
oratioe where the first term is greater than the second, five kinds were
distinguished: λόγοι πολλαπλάσιοι, λ. ἐπιμόροοι, λ. ἐπιμερεῖς, λ. remoram·
επιμόρονι, and λ. πολλαπλασιεπιμερεῖς. Α multiple ratio is one whose first term
contains the second an exact number of times (op. cit, c. 23, p. 76,s Hiller);
a superpartientes ratio is one whose first term contains the second once and
also an aliquot part of the second (c. 24, p. 76, u); aeupepurts'ent ratio is
one whose first term contains the second once and also more than one aliquot
part of the second (c. 25, p. 78, ο), multiplea-superpartientes (c. 26, p. 78, as)
and multiplea-superpartiens (c. 27, p. 79, u) ratios are like the last two kinds,
but the first terme contain the second terme more than once, plus a fraction.
Theon gives a sixth kind (op. cit, c. 28, p. 80, r), namely, λόγος ἀριθμοῦ πρός
ἀριθμόν (found also in Ptolemy, Hem, 1. ν, p. 10 Wallis). I do not see why
this is not included under one of the other kinds. The example given is
the reticos 256 to 243, which is superpartient. The ὑπόλογον have the same
names as the πρόλογον with the prefix όπο- added, as όποδιπλόσοος.
