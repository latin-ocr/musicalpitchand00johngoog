1ἀίά., 11 (p. 7 Κ. v. J an) ι ὥστε ἡ πληγὴ τοῦ ἀναπνεομένου
ἀέρος ὑπὸ τῆς ἐν τούτοις τοῖς μορίοις ψυχῆς πρὸς τὴν καλου-
μένην ἀρτηρίαν φωνή ἐστιν· οὐ γὰρ πᾶς ζῴου ψόφος φωνή,

καθάπερ εἴπομεν (ἔστι γὰρ καὶ τῇ ιγλώττῃ ψοφεῖν καὶ ὡς οἱ
βήττοντες), ἀλλὰ δεῖ ἔμψυχόν τε εἶναι καὶ μετὰ φαντασίας
τινός· σημαντικὸς «γὰρ δή τις ψόφος ἐστὶν ἡ φωνὴ καὶ οὐ τοῦ
ἀναπνεομένον ἀέρος ὥσπερ ὁ βήξ.

It appears, then, that whereas φωνή is used properly of the
voice only, the term was applied also to the tones of musical
instrumente. Aristoxenus speaks of φωνὴ ὀργανική τε καὶ
ἀνθρωπική (Herm, p. 14 Meib.).

The analysis of articulate sound into its phonetic elements
is important to the art of writing, and consequently the
various vowel-sounds and consonant-sounds must have been
differentiated from very early times, since it was this that
led to the invention of writing by letters to take the place of
ideographio writing.

Another important principle of division is involved in the
distinction between musical and unmusical sounds. This
classification concerns chiefly the Scienoe of Music. As Pho-
netios disregards all but articulate sounds, so the Scienoe of
Music deals only with musical sounds. It should be observed
that the line which separatos musical sounds from unmusioal
sounds crosses that which separatos articulate and inarticulate
sounds. An articulate sound may be either musical or un-
mnsical; so may an inarticulate sound. ’

What, then, is meant by musical and unmusical or non-
musical? In the first place, the term ‘musical,' as used in
this connection, does not, of course, mean merely ‘used in
music! In that case it would only be necessary to enumerate
the kinds of sounds so used. On the contrary, many sounds
which must be classed with musical sounds are unsuitable for
use in music on account of difficulties attending their pro-
duction or for some other reason ; and many unmusical sounds
are used in music to produce certain effecte, generally of a
rhythmioal nature. NeverthelesS, it is true in a general way
