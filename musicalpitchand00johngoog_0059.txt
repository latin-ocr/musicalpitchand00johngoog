K. v. J.).¹ The important feature of the monochord is that
the tension of the parts of the string is necessarily the samo
as that of the whole string. The clement of tension is thus
eliminated.

The intervals to which attention would naturally first be
directed in investigatione into the ratios are the consonant
intervals. The terms consonant and dissonant refer, of course,
to the character of the intervals in regard to the smoothncss
or roughness of the combination of sounds. By far the greater
number of possible intervals are dissonant. A small number
of certain definite sices or widths are consonant. In the matter
of sice they seem to bear no particular relation with one another
and with dissonant intervals. As we have scen,2 they are in-
commensurable quantities. As to their consonance, they vary
markedly among themselves, and the smoothness of the same
consonant interval will vary according to the absolute position
of the combination in the scale of acuteness and graveness and
according to the timbre of the notes. But at the same time
each consonant interval can always be recognized with cassand
certainty, and, moreover, is fixed in point of eine within narrow
limits by reason of the physical causes of the consonance. Such
intervals are especially adapted to investigations into the rela-
tions which exist between the vibration-numbers, and between
the lengths of the vibrating stringe and of the columns of air
producing the notes. ,

In regard to the number of consonances and the question of
classifying intervals as consonant or dissonant, it is unnecessary
here to name the intervals regarded by the Greeks as conso·
nant, except to state that the number of consonant intervals
varied from time to time, but was always considerably less
than the number recognized in modern theory. Many of the
