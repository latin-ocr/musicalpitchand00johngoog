x Again, the Pythagorean School 01, musical theorists, 111010

mathematically inclined than their opponente, 1110 Aristoxe-
neans, consistently denied that the Fisth and Fourth were
equal 10 31 and 2} Tenes respectively. But as in modern ·
theory these incontrovertible facts are often conscionsly or un·
consciously ignored, so in the ancient musical world we find
the Aristoxenean School using the semitono, defined as half
01 1110 Whole-tone (which in turn is defined as the difference
between the Fisth 01111 the Fourth) as a unit 1011110 measure-
ment 01 011 other intervals. It is inconvenient‚ to say 1110
least, 10 11ον0 110 unit supplied by nature, and 101 the purposes
01 0 practioal 1101011011 somesortof 00 approximate unit would
seem 10 be almost a necessity 101 0 11111010 developed 10 the
point 01 demanding different keys and 11101100. Ι11 teaching,
mcreover, it is very desirable 10 be able 10 regard that scale
(with 110 the chromatio) in which progression is made by the
smallest steps recognized, as composed 01 equal-sized intervals.

For rougher measurements, then, we are fully justified in
assuming as a unit whatever interval we find most convenient
101 the purpose. The size 01 such an interval will, 01 course,
depend on the nature 01 1110 music concerned. Thus 111 Η1111111
Μ11010 the Octave is regarded as consisting 01 22 0111011 intervals
(crutis), such 11101 nine 01 them make a Fourth and thirteen
a Fifth‚ and consequently four make 1110 Major Whole-tone.
In Arabian Musio 17 approximately equal intervals compose
the Octave. But ancient Greek Music, like modern European
Music, recognizes 011 0010νο 01 12 nominally equal small
1111011010(ἡμιτόνια, Semitones) 01 which five make up the
Fourth and seven the¹ Fiith and two the Το110, which is their
difference. They are, however, unlike in this, that, while in
modern Music no interval differing very widely from the
twelfth part 01 011 Octave 01 some multiple thereos is used, in
ancient Greek Music, 011 1110 contrary, the existence at various
periods 01 Quarter- and Third-tenes (equal to one-half and
two-thirds of 1110 Semitone respectively) is well attested. For
this reason the Tene is perhaps a better 111111 101 rough meas·
