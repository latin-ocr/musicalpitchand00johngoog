be the τροφόν, and that the Pythagoream hit on this as an

explanation for the number 5 from the following considera-
tions. The interval is so small that the differencc in the two
pitches is but little, if any, wider than those differences in
pitch which make a note out of tune to the average ear.
That is, it is about the smallest interval which differs suffi-
ciently from unison to be entitled to the designation ‘musical
interval! We feel a natural reluctance to calling minute
pitch·differenoes by the same name as those evident altera-
tions of pitoh on which music is based. In considering the
effect of cutting off the small divisione one after the other
experimenters may easily have corneto the conclusion that
the first of the 256 parts (apparently called ‘ intervals of the
tone,’ but for what reason we can only surmisc, for the phrase
does not occur elsewhere as iar as I am aware) makes no interval
‘which can be sounded' (φθεγκτόν), nor does the second, nor
the third, nor the fourth, but the fiith gives a note which can
be regarded as forming a distinct interval with the open
string. The passage will then run: “ The Pythagoreans

called five τροφόν [‘food' apparently 1]—that is a (musical)

(ll = li >< ffl), it is probable that about 15 of the 256 parts would be
taken (16 would be the exact number to take) for sounding the Semitone,
instead of the 13 required lor the Leimma; consequently a third of them
would fall very near to the 5 which form the desired interval

¹In the above I have regarded τροφόν as the accusative of the neuter
form rb τροφόν, meaning ‘food, nourishment' which occurs in Plato, Polit,
289 A. It has been suggested to me that we may have here the accusative
ol the commoner masculine and feminine τροφός ‘feeder, nourisher, nurse,'
that the number 5 is personified after a lashion characteristic os the Pytha·
goreans. For example 7 was called Ἀθηνᾶ and παρθένος, because alone
among the numbers which composa the decade, 7 neither generates noris
generated, that is, it is neither a factor nor a multiple of any other number
in the decade (ef. Theon. Smyrn, de mus, o. 46, p. 103 Hiller). Somewhat
similarly5 was sometimes called γάμος because it can be regarded as the
union or marriage os the first odd number, 3, which is male, with the first
even number, 2, which is female (1 is a number spart). The thought
would then seem to be that 5 plays the rtle of a nurse in bringing out the
first sound which is φθεγκτόν.
