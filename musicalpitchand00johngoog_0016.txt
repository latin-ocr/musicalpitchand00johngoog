MUSlCAL PlTCH

THE MEASUREMENT OF INTERVALS AMONG THE
ANClENT GREEKS.

ΤΗΕ material available for reconstructing the musio of
classical antiquity is unfortunately not very abundant. In
the case of the other fine arts, it is possible for the modern
world actually to realize the art of the ancients through the

monuments of their activity which have survived to our day.
This is pre’e'minently the case with the three great space-ants,
sculpture, architectum, and painting. We are ableto obtain
an immediate appreciation of these arta by actual contempla-
tion of sculptural, architectural, and pictorial remains, and the
extent of our appreciation will depend on the degree to which,
from the nature of the material used, these remains have been
able to withstand the destructive agenoies of time and the ele-
ments. In this way those arts in which stone was so generally
the material employed have sared better than those in which
a less durable medium was used. We may compare architec-
ture and sculpture with painting and the ceramio art in this
matter. But in all of them the appreciation is immediate;
the oontaot between the ancient and the modern world is direct.
It is possible to study the actual creatione of ancient art, and
it is not necessary to rely wholly or even partly on indirect
means of approach, like theoretical treatises and chance allu-
sions in literature.
