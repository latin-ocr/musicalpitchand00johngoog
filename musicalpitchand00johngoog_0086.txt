writers on the theory of music, butas proof of real variations
in the pitch of the notes and then endeavor to account for
these variations, when not attributable to imperfectioris in the
tuning, as due to influenoes which we cannot traco which in
process of tirne wrought gradual changes in the intonation of
the notes as actually sung and played.
