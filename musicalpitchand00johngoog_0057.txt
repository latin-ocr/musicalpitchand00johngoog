either for counting the number of vibrations or for aocurately
measuring small intervals of time like the second. Conse-
quently ancient determinatione of the ratios of intervals were
generally based on other consideratione. The most convenient
method consisted of a comparison of the lengths of the stringo
which produce the required notes, when the strings are made of
a uniform thickness and are subjected to the same tension.
As it happens, the lengths of stringo are inversely propor-
tional to their vibration-numbers, so that results obtained by
one method may readily be compared with those obtained by
the other. This is most easily done when two notes only are
involved, but the comparison is made without difficulty even
when there is a series of notes. Other methodo employed were
the comparison of the lengths of the pipes of wind instruments
of equal bore 3 the comparison ol' the distances at which finger-
holes must be bored to produce given notes 3 and the compari·
son of the weights necessary to stretch strings of equal length
as well as siae, so as to produce notes which will form the
required interval.¹ Only very rough results could have been
obtained from the methodo last mentioned. In the caseos
instruments like the flute (αὐλός) it is very difficult to deter-
mine accurately the length of the vibrating column of air, and·
it is necessary that the bore of the instrument be of uniform
siae throughout and that the siae of the finger-hules be the
same. A hole of smaller diameter may be substituted for one
of larger diameter further removed from the mouth-pisce.
Ancient flute-makers undoubtedly availed themselves of this
principle in tuning their instruments.2 For ascertaining in-
terval ratios by measuring the distances at which the holes are
placed it would be necessary to have holes of one siae only.

In using strings of equal length and thicknesS, stretched by
hanging weights of different sines, great care would have to be
