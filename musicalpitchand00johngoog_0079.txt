sound—on the supposition that of the intervals of the tone
the fifth is the first which can be sounded.'’ In support
of this theory of the musical signification of 5we have the
parallel cases of the numbers 13 and 27, whose connection

with musical intervals arises, as we have seen, from the terms .
of the ratios (expressing their siae) derived from the mono-
chord with a scale of 256 equal divisions. The three numbers,
5, 13, and 27, are then (not quite exactly) proportional to the
siaes of the intervals, the τροφόν, the λεῖμμα, and the Tone,
since they are all three measured on the same scale. The
Pythagorean τροφόν is then, I take it, a small interval with
the ratio 2512256, and was connected with the number 5,
because 5 is the arithmetical difference between the terms of
the ratio, just as 13 and 27 are arithmetical differences.1

In the foregoing pages we have cited and discussed some
of the more important passages in which the ratios of the
primary consonances are either established or assumed aa
known, with the objectos showing that the ancieuts were
thoroughly familiar with the numerical relations which exist
between musical notes, aud that they made free use of the
resulting ratios in measuring the sine of intervals. A oon-
siderable number of additional passages could be adduoed,
were it necessary in a matter which is osten taken for granted.
Moreover‚ it is not necessary in the case of the consonant
intervals to examine closely the value of the experimenta by

¹In the explanation given above,-that it is only when tha minute in·
terval corresponding to the fifth of the 256 equal parts of a vibrating string
is joined to the four which preceded that a ‘soundable' interval is obtained,
and that ὅ stands for this interval,-it is not a serious objection that the
writer first calls h a φθόγγος and then seems to identify it with an interval.
The confusion between a note and the interval which it forms with some
given note isos frequent occurrence; each new round brings in a new in·
terval, i. c. with the open string. The difficulty can, however, be removed
by changlng φθόγγον to φθόγγου or φθόγγων. Π φθόγγον is kept, ean it be
that φόφον should be read for οροφόνθ The clause ὅπερ ἐστὶ φθόγγον would
seem to support this emendation in view of the fact that φθόγγος and ψόφος
were not always carefully differentiated.
