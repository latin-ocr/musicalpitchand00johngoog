The number 27 is, then, derived from the numbers artaud

243, used to express the ratio os the Tone which stands next
to the Leimma when whole numbers are used to illustrate the
diatonic division 01 the tetrachord (Fourth) used in the scales
01 the 1111111111.

The series given above is found in a number 01 the commen-
taries on the double quaternion (1.9, Theo Smyrnaeus, de 11111,
c. 14, p. 67,1a, sq. Hiller3 Plutarch, de 01111. proca, c. 18,
1021 Ε, sq.; Nicomachus, eccepto, 2, p. 30 Meib. (p. 267
Κ. v. J .)),¹ and is sufficient when a single tetrachord is under
consideration. But when a whole Octave 01 the binary scale
is expressed in whole numbers and the second Leimma appears,
it is necessary to double the numbers which make up the series.
This gives: 384 (Tone) 432 (Tene) 486 (Leimma) 512² for the
first tetrachord. Theon gives this series (loc. oia, p. 68, n, sq.
Hiller), and mentions the objection 10 11 that it does not give
the ratio given by Plato for the Leimma, 243 : 256, with its
’ (1111111110113, but, aa he truly remarks, the ratio of 1111 Leimma
may be expressed in other numbers, as 486 : 512. Chapter
16 01 Ρ111111111’1 de anim. proce. (1019 Ε, sq.) gives the process
by which these numbers 111 obtained. If 384 11 taken 101 the
first term of the binary and ternary scales, all the following
terms in both the branches can be expressed in whole numbers.⁸

ι111 Plato small numbers represent acute sounds, and the scales run
downward from unity, 10 that the Leimmata are at the grave end 01 the
tetrachords; but in Plutarch and Nicomachus the reversa is the case, and
the Leimma in each tetrachord stands above the Tones (Plut, 101111, 1021
F: τοῦ γὰρ βαρυτέρου τόνῳ ἐπιταθέντος, ὅπερ ἐστὶν ἐπόγδοον, γίγνεται σις’·
τούτου πάλιν τόνῳ ἄλλῳ ἐπιταθέντος, γίγνεται σμγ’· . . . . (1022 A) περίεστι

διὸ κα1 λεῖμμα τοῦτον τὸν ἀριθμὸν ὠνόμαζον. 11100111, loc. cic, ἐπιτείνουσι).
The 1111111101 figures can illustrate these two situations according as they
stand 101 length 01 stringor for vibration numbers. cf. Thoonem Smyr·
nasum, p. 6510 Η11111.

'The whole series is: 384-432-486-512-576-648-729-768.
