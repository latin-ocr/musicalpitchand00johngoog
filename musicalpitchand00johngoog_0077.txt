as proportional to the lengths of the vibrating stringe or, in
modern manner, tu the vibration-numbers of the notes.l On
the other hand, they connected the result (13, the sum of the ‘
equares) with a particular ratio, which they used to express a
certain interval occurring in their scales. The fact that the
numbers concerned in these operatione oen be dealt with in
this way is the merest coincidence. It is nothing more than
an arithmetical accident (to call it such) that the sum of the
equares should equal the differenoe between 256 and 243, or
that the sum of the cubes should also be the sum of 6, 8, 9,
and 12, numbers in which an arithmetioal and an harmonioal
progressior can be found. But such is the state of affairs.

It remains that we should consider the sum of the first
putere, the number 5, which the Pythagoreans called τροφόν,
according to the passage from Plutarch quoted on p. 55. So
far as Iam aware, no explanation has ever been given for
this number, beyond what is contained in Plutarch’s words.
They are (de cuim. proca, o. 12, 1017 F): οἱ Πυθαγορικοὶ

τὰ μὲν ε’ τροφόν, ὅπερ ἐστὶ φθόγγον, ἐκάλουν, οἰόμενοι τῶν

τοῦ τόνου διαστημάτων πρῶτον εἶναι φθεγκτὸν τὸ πέμπτον.
The following seems to meto be the solution of the problem.
Using the same apparatus as we had in the experiment just
described, if we measure off 5 of the 256 equal parts and stop
the string at that point, we obtain a small interval about
a third of a Semitone in size.² This interval I believe to

¹It is immaterial whether we run up the scale or down, since the three
intervals are symmetricolly arranged (an epitrita ratio on either side of the
epogdobn).

’An idea ot the width of this interval may be gained without the trouble
of dividing a string into 256 parts After sounding the open string of an
instrument lihe the violin, play as accurately as possible, by ear, a note at
the interval of a Semitone to the acute, by pressing on the string with the
finger, divide the piece of striug cut oti for the Semitone into three equal
parts; then press down the first of the three (that nearest the end of the
ming), so aa to keep it from vibrating. The remaining string will give
a note aeuter than the open string hythe interval in question. Since
our ‘natural’ Semitone is slightly larger than the Pythagoream Leimnrs
