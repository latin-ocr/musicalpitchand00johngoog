from facts presented to us in the history of modern theory, it
is not extravagant to suppose that intervals of nearly the same
sire as the Tone were often mistahen for the Tone, and that
the Tone personated these intervals, so to speah. If there
were intervals in ancient Greek scales whose sine differed from
that of the Tone in question by only a small amount (and the
existence of such intervals is not only possible, but is distinctly
asserted by many of the ancients), it would be a most natural
Ι error to suppose such intervals to be actual Tones and to call
them Tones and to tune them as such on instrumenta. Yet
they would not for all that be the same interval as the Tonc,
nor would they cease to be intoned according to the dictatas of
artistic feeling whenever the instrument permitted this to be
done, as in vocal music. In modern music there are two
intervals, approaching the Tcne (more accurately called the
Major-tone) in point of siae, which are used quite as freely as
it is. They arethe Supersecond or Septimal-second (ratio 7:8)
and the Minor-tone (ratio 9 210), one wider, the other narrower,
than the Major-tone (ratio 829). These intervals can be
accurately intoned in vocal and violin music, but on keyed
instrumenta (with the usual number of heys) they are all
three represented hythe same tempered interval. The small
inaccuracies are overlooked, and the intervals are all called
Tones alihe. A similar state of affairs may have existed in
ancient music. Scales in which Major-tones predominate are ‘
open to suspicion on that account. In the next paragraph we
shall see that the scale constructed in the Timaea-of Plato is
artificial in this respect.

The earliest passage in which the consonant ratios are
mentioned is perhaps Plat0, Timaea, 35 B, sq.l It is to be
observed‚ however, that there is nowhere any reference to
music in the text. The scale herc constructed is essentially a
theoretical one. The procedure is as follows. hirst, the
