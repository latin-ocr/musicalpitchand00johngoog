The areas of the four compartments will then be 6, 8, 9, and
12 (sum, 35): 3 4

These numbers eontain the arithmetica] progression 6-9—
12 and the harmonical progression 6-8-123 in the former
we have the ratio of the Fisth (223) followed by thet of the
Fcurth (324), in the latter, the order is reversed, while the

ratio of the extremes is thet of the Octave (122), and the
ratio of the two means is that of the Tone (8 :9). Διὰ τοῦτο

ἐκάλεσαν (loc. cit, 1018 Β). The musical notes correspond-
ing to these numbers are: ὑπάτη-μέση-πορομέση-νήτη,
the intervals between them being Fourth, Tone, Fourth.¹

Plutarch next multiplies like powers of 2 and 3(chapter
13, 1018 B, sq.). The products, 6, 36, and 216, are, of course,
the first, second, and third powers of 6. In commenting on
these numbers, the remark is made that 36 is the smallest
number which is at once a square and a triangle, for it is
the square of 6 and the triangle² of 8 (τρίγωνος ἀπὸ τῆς

¹This Pythagorean ‘harmony’ of four notes is supposed to have been
discovered by the philosopher on his famous visit to the smithy, when he
noticed that the hammers used gave notes which formed the various con·
sonances. On returning home, it is said, he fastened weights proportional
to those of the hammers to four stringe of equal length, and thus obtained
the four notes of the harmony. cf. lamblichus, Itys os Pythagoraa, xxvr.
(117) sq.; Plutarch, de musica, c. 22, 1138 0, sq.; c. 23, 1139 Β, sq. The
four notes stand at the same intervals from one another aedo the tonic,
subdominant, dominant, and tonic again, in modern music. The arith·
metical progression gives the dominant, and the harmonical progressior
(so called sor this reason) gives the subdeminant.

'On triangular numbers, see Theo Smyrn, dc rabac math. etc, p. 33 Hiller
(= dc crt'ttrretica, c. 19), and p. 37, t, sq. (c. 23). The number in question,
36, is the sum of 1, 2, 3, 4, t, 6, 7, and 8.
