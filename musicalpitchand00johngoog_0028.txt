Ιο the laet division (that in which sounds of constant pitch
were separated from sounds of varying pitch) the principle
employed was the behavior of pitch from moment to moment,
its changeability or constancy. We are now led to suggest
another principle which might be used to subdivide once
again those sounds which are characterized by the presence of
pitch. It is the complexity or simplicity of the arrangement
of the various heights or degrees of pitch which are present
at any and every point of time in every sound except the
theoretically pure tone of science. If the constituent pitchee
are arranged with reference to some principle of order, so
that the pitchee 000 related, the sound will be musical, and on
this order will depend the quality or timbre of the note. On
the other hand, if the arrangement is disorderly‚ the sound
will be unmusical or noisy. As we have noticed before, a
bell may have been οο unsuccesefully cast that, apart from
the variation so noticeable from timeto time, the different
parts give forth sounds of different and unrelated pitchee.
The result is a 00100. If all the heys of 0 piano which
one can cover with the hand are sounded at once, a noise
10 produced.

Applying this principle of order in the constituent pitchee
to the 01000 of sounde whose pitch 10 constant, we obtain two
sections, into one of which all sounds which it seems inappro-
priate to eall ‘musical' will be collected. Similarly, in the
codrdinate 01000 of sounds whose pitch varies, one section will
comprise those eounds which 000 musical 10 every particular
except the variation in pitch (e. 9, the glide of the portamento,
the sound of a boatman's siren), the other will include sounds
which are noisy both from the quality of the tone and from

the variation in the pitch (c. 9, the creaking of a hinge).

If we use thie principle of order in a slightly different
manner, we may subdivide varying sounds according as the
variation is orderly and limited by fixed bounds (e. 9., porta-
mento), 00 10 not. When orderly, the variation is generally
