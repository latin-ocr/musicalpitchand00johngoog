urement than the Semitone. Whether cr not the subtle
retinements known as Ohroai, which were varieties of the
quanter-tone system (peace enbommnicum) and of the third·
tone system (penus chrmaoticum), corresponded to phenomena
actually observed, the fact remains that Greek theoretioal
writers used thirtieths and even sixtieths of the Fourth in
their explanatione of these various penora. These intervals
would then be twelsths and twenty-fourths of a compromise
Tone obtained by taking exactly two-fifths of a Fourth. It
is easy to see that a mean Tone of this sine is not equal tc an
muel-temperament Tone, because a Fourth falls short of five
equal-temperament Semitones, and consequently two-fifths cf
a Fourth fall short of an ‘equal' Tene. Moreover, this mean
Tene, depending as it does on the Fcurth, like the Fourth, is
not an aliquot part of the Octave. In like manner neither
the thirtieth nor the sixt-ieth part of a Fourth isan aliquot
part cf the Octavo. In their more accurate measurements of
intervals the Greeks used the Fourth as a standard of length,
where moderns use the Oetave. In this respect and in some

others the Fourth played the part now taken by the Octava.
For rougher calculatione, as we have seen, the Tene and the
Semitone-sixth and twelith of the Octave respectively-were
used. But the most perfect of all the methods is that in which
the sine of intervals is determined by the ratio¹ between the
numbers found to belong to the notes.

¹Ratio is defined by Euolid in the following words (Euclid, Elementa, V.
def. 3)2 “ Ratio is a mutual relation oi two magnitudes of the same kind to
one another in respect of quantity,'' or rather'of “quantuplicity.’' It is
immaterial which of the two magnitudes first receives the attentione? the
mind. Itis also a matter oi indifference which term oia ratic is regarded
as compared with the other, whether the larger is compared with the
smaller or the smaller with the larger, provided one or the other method is
comistently adhered to during one and the same operation. It is usual to
consider the term first mentioned to be compared with the term laet men·
tioned, ae 2 tc 3, i. a, 2 compared with 3. But if we wish to compare two
rstica, as 223 and 527, tc see which is the larger or wider, we may either
take the antecedente, 2 and 5, as standards, and so prcoeed to change the
