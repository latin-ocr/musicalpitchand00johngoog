We have then in the ratios a trustworthy means of identi-
fying ancient Greek intervals with their modern equivalents
and of realizing the siae of those intervals which are not
recognized incur modern European system. We are forced to
seek other causes for the great number of dissonant intervals
which we find in the theory of Greek music thau supposed
defects in the instrumenta of measurement.

We have already seen that the facility with which the cou-
sonant intervals may be accurately tuned, or perhaps it would
be better to say the artistic necessity to tune them accurately,
is a guarantee that any fluctuatione in their measured sizeare
due to the measurements and not to any variations in their
real size, and that, since no such fluctuations are recorded
even when the experimenters professed to make the lineat of
distinctions, it is reasonable to conclude that all the measure·
ments were made with the degree of care and precision
claimed for them. The other side of this characteristic
difference between consonant and dissonant intervals is the
difficulty of tuning the latter with precision and the absence
of any necessity for great precision. This we consider to
have been a much more fertile cause of variations in their
recorded siue than any impossibility of eliminating errors duc
to the measuring apparatus. In the case of instruments
which require frequent tuning, such as the lyre and other
stringed instrumento, much evidently depends ou the ear for
pitch-differences of the individual performer. In the case of
instruments whose tones are lixed in pitch at the time of
manufacture, like the αὐλός and fingored stringed instrumeuts
when their tones depeud on fixcd frets along the finger-board,
the same personal element enters in the (original) tuning of
the instrument, and is complicated by the fact that the pitch
of the notes could be regulated during the performanoe by
the force of the hreath in the case of wind-instruments and
by pressure on the string behind the frets of fingered stringcd
instruments, and in other ways. And in vocal music this
difficulty of tuning notes at dissonant intervals from one
