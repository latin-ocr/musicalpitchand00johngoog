nssd to denote pitch, and for those used to mark the rhythm.
In fact in most of the known remains of Greek music, the
rhythm is left to bc determined by the metre of the words to
which the music was sung. It will moreover readily be ad-
mitted that errors in the interpretation of the rhythm would
not result in so thorough a misunderstanding as would errors
in the translation of the pitch-values of the ancient notes.

The first step in this important determination of the pitch-
valna may well be to discover the order or successiones the
notes in the matter of acuteness and'graveness. The next
would then be to ascertain the exact distanoes at which the
notes stand with reference to one another. As to the mere
order of the notes, several of the ancient treatises supply us
with this information, but when the notes are enumeratedtp
nunu alone and not by written symbol, we must still obtain
a correspondence between the written notes and their names.
This we are able to do by means of the diagrams which are
found in the invaluable work of Alypius, and in the works of
Gaudentius and Bacchius Senior. By means of this informa-
tion alone we could plot a curve of any ancient melody, such
that every rise and fall in pitch was represented, and only the
amount of this motion would remain undetermined. The
second step supplies this deficiency. We ascertain for each
note the distance or interval at which it stands from its neigh-
bors. This done, we are in possession of all the knowledpe
necessary to reproduoe the sounds denoted by the ancient no-
tation. Our ability to trauslcte the notation correctly into
the modern notation, and to reproduoe the sounds vocally or
iustrumentally, will, of course, depend for the most part on
the similarity of the music in question to modern music.

The present dissertation is concerned with this second step,

and is an attempt to show to what extent our knowledge of
the absolute width of musical intervals in general among the
Greeks is based on firm foundations. No attempt is made to
show what are the modern equivalents for the actual notes
employed in their music, nor to estabhsh the width of the
