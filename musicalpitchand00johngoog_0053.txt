and not, of course,to add them, it follows that the aum of
two intervals cannot be obtained by direct addition of their

ratios, nor are ratios so related that a common constituent can
be found which could serve as a measure of their relative sine.
“ If we wish to have a measure of intervals in the proper
sense, we must take, not the characteristic ratio itself, but the
logarithm of that ratio. Then, and then only, will the measure
ofa compound interval be the sum of the mensures of the
components‚'' ¹ and when this has been done all the logarithms,
with a few exceptione, will be found to be incommensurable.
But of course, the sine of any interval can be calculated to
any required degree of accuracy.

This great fact of the incommensurability of musical inter-
vals was known to the Greeks. It was recognized to be true
both practically and theoretically. The eleventh chapter of
the first book of Ptolemy's Haemonios contains first a mathe-
matical demonstration that six Tones exceed an Octavo, and
the amount of this excess, it is then stated, is pereeptihle eveo
to the eor. Earlier writers than Ptolemy prove mathematically
that six Tones exceed an Octave by an interval (called the
Pythagorean Comma) whose ratio is talasa ε 531,441. Since
this excess is slightly larger than the Comma cf Didymus
(80 ε 81) which is the differenoe between the Major and the
Minor Whole-tone (or between the true or just Major-third
and the Pythagorean Major-third), Ptolemy's statement is not
in the least incredible. All the difficulties sought to be obvi-
ated by the device of equal temperament arise from small
intervals, which are rarely larger than the Comma (80 r 81)
by even a quarter of its aize. If such intervals are felt by
moderas, we cannot deny to the ancients ability to perceive
small intervals of the same sine. The existence ,of Quarter·
tones at one period, at least, in the development of Greek
music, points to a high degree of cultivation among the
ancients of the feeling for pitch-differences.
