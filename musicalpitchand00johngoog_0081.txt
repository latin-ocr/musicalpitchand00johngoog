for this intervallar width and now for that, whether conscious-
ness of these differences exist or not. If the existence of the
small hut real difference is unknown to the experimenters‚ an
apparently variable character will be imparted to the interval
supposed to be undergoing measurement, resulting in discrep-
ancies in the magnitudes assigned to it by different observers.
We must he assured that we are in fact dealing with only a
single difference of pitoh and not with two or more. Lastly
we must take into account the imperfectioris of the instrument
on which the measurements are made. Within what limite
are errors due to the instrumente confined‘l If now the width
. of an ancient interval is given by a certain ratio, these points
must be taken into consideration. We must ask, Was the
interval such that musicians could tune the notes forming it
so asto give invariably the same width‘? Was there no
neighboring interval with which it could be confounded? and
then, How accurately was it possible with the existing iustru-
ments to measure the interval when truned 5⁹

Ieaving the accuraoy of the measuring instrumente asido
for the present, as a matter in regard to which we have but
little direct knowledge, if we turn to consider the nature of
the intervals, we notice immediately this striking difference
between consonant and dissonant intervals, that the former
can be tuned with a high degree of precision, while in the
case of the latter there is a far greater range within which the
siae of the interval may vary without attracting attention.
It is well known that small errors in the intonation of the
more dissonant intervals are more readily overlooked than
are errors of the same size in the case of mistuned conso·
nances. The reason for this is that the consonant intervals
are bounded on all sides by harsh ‹liscords—harsher discorde
exist only among the small intervals which stand next to
unison. For example, il' the Octave be made a little too
large or a little too small, the result is a painfully dissonant
interval, and the same holds true in the case of the other
consonances, when put slightly out of tune. It follows that
