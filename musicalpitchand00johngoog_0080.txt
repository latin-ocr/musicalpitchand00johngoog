means cf which the ancients mad'e their original determina-
tions of these retice, inasmuch as the true ratio of a conso·
nance could have been derived‚¹ and as a matter of fact
must have been derived in the first instance, from imperfect
observations by a sort of intuitive preference for simple
ratios. But when one comes to the consideration of the
numerous *divisione of the tetrachord according to pecata and
ctroc (color), in which Greek musical theory abounded it
becomes important to ascertain whether the measurements
given for these dissonant intervals hythe methodos ratios
are to be trusted as true indicatione of their sine. Many of
these intervals are so utterly foreign to modern European .
music that it is difficult to believe that they were actually of
the width ascribed to them. We refer to such intervals as
the Quarter-tones in the enharmonio pentae, the intervals of
three-quarters and five-quarters of a Tone in the διάτονον
μαλακόν, and the intervals in the χρῶμα μαλακόν and
χρῶμα ἡμιόλιον.

The degree of accuracy attainable in measuring the size of
any interval depende upon several consideratione. In the
first place intervals differ vastly among themselves in the

exactness with which they may be tuned.² Variations may
be ducto the failure of the experimenters to obtain uniformly
the ideal intonation of the interval. In the next place inter·
vals of nearly the same siae are apt to be confounded. We
have already alluded to the fact that in modern music the

interval known to musicians as the Tone is not an interval of
fixed width. In the same way the term Semitone is used now

¹ Α. J. Ellis is unwilling to give the ancients credit sor accuracy in thess
measurements. He says (Helmholtz, Scurtioaeoslbac, and Eng. ed, p. 15,
note ⁴⁶) : “ As the monochord is very liable to error, these results were happy
generalisations from necessarily imperfect experiments.” But Helmholtz
says (cp. cit, p. 14): “ These measurements had been executed with great
precision by the Greek musiniano, and had given rise to a system os tones,
contrived with considerable art.''
