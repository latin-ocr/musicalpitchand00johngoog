chapter to pitch, and then one to sounds1 and their differences.
The separation of sounds into two classes according aa pitch
· is present or absent is implied (unless, to be sure, pitch is
attributed to all sounds whatsoever). The first classification
we meet with is that by which sounds which have a pitch are
divided into two groups according to the nature of that pitch.
Ψόφοι, he says (Ptolemy, Herm, 1. iv„ p. 8 Wallis), are either
ἰσότονον or ἀνισότονοι; the former are sounds which are un-
ehangeable in the matteras pitch (ἀπαράλλακτον κατὰ τὸν
τόνον), the latter are those which change their pitch (παρολ-
λάσσοντες).’

Ptolemy next takes ψόφοι ἀνισότονοι and divides them into
οἱ συνεχεῖς and οἱ διωρισμένον.8 Definitions follow. “ Con-

¹Tlre title of the chapter, περὶ φθόγγον, καὶ τῶν ἐν αὐτοῖς διαφορῶν, must
be wrong. Read περὶ ψόφων nri.

²The equality and inequality of pitch implied in the words ἲοότονος and
&varirosae refer, of course, in this passage to the possibility of change which
any sound may undergo in the course of its existence But these terms are
also used in a very different sense—a sense which is met with in the next
chapter of Ptolemy's treatise, and evenat the end of the present chapter.
Ambiguity in the use oi terms has always been in Music a peculiarly fertile
source of misunderstanding. The differcnce in the meanings is well stated
by Porphyry in his commentary cn this passage (conmemorans, c. 4, p. 258
Wallis). The second use of the words will not cause any difficulty, since
the differcnoe is so clear. In this meaning the τόνος refers to the pitch of
notes as compared with other notes, and used in this way the terma are of fre-
quent service in demonstratione of the Pythagorean theory cf consonances.
Porphyry's words are: ῥητέον πάλιν, ὣς ἲσότονος ό ψόφος λέγεται διχῶς· ό μὲν
ἄλλῳ ψόφῳ ἴσην τὴν τόσον κεκτημένος, ὥσπερ ἦ νήτη συνημμένον τῇ παρανήτη
διεζευγμένων λέγεται εἶναι ἲσότονος. (similarly we might say that E sharp
in the hey of B Major was ‘equitonic’ with F, or Ο sharp with D flat.) Such
an tetracos ψόφος, Porphyry continues, is more properly called όμότονος, and
not merely ψόφος, but φθόγγος. The other meaning refers to the parts os
one and the same sound‚ as the beginning, middle, and end. Such a sonnd,
he says, might with more exactness be called όμοιομερής. ’

lIt may be well at this point to tabulate Ptolemy's classes of munds:

ἲσότονοι.
limi συνεχεῖς.
