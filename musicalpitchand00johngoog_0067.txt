αὐλοῖς τῷ διπλασίῳ διαστήματι λαμβάνεται τὸ διδ πασῶν,
καὶ οἱ αὐλοτρῦπαι οὕτω λαμβάνουσιν. καὶ οἱ τὰς σύρνγιγας
ἁρμοττόμενοι εἰς μὲν τὴν ὑπάτην σ’ίιιραν τὸν κηρὸν ἐμπλάτ-
τουσι, τὴν δὲ νήτην μέχρι τοῦ ἡμίσεος ἀναπληροῦσιν. ὁμοίως
δὲ καὶ τὴν διὰ πέντε τῷ ἡμιολίῳ καὶ τὴν διὰ τεττάρων τῷ
ἐπιτρίτῳ διαστήματι λαμβάνουσιν. ἔτι καὶ ε’ν τοῖς τριγώνοις
φαλτηρίοις τῆς ίσης ἐπιτάσεως γινομένης συμφωνοῦσι διδ
πασῶν ἡ μὲν διπλασία οὖσα ἡ δὲ ἡμίσεια τῷ μήκει.

1δίά., 50 (p. 111 K. v. J.): Διὰ τί ῖσων πίθων καὶ ὁμοίων
ε’δν μὲν ὁ ἕτερος ιιενδς ᾖ, ὁ δὲ ἕτερος ει’ς τὸ ἡμισυ διάμεστος,
διὰ πασῶν συμφωνεῖ ἡ ἠχώ ,·-Ἢ ὅτι διπλασία «γίνεται ἡ ἐκ
τοῦ ἡμίσεος τῆς ἐκ τοῦ κενοῦ; τί γὰρ διαφέρει τοῦτο ἡ ἐπὶτῶν
συρίγγων,· δοκεῖ γὰρ ἡ θάττων κίνησις ὀξυτέρα εἶναι, ἐν δὲ
τοῖς μείζοσι βραδύτερον ὁ ἀὴρ ἀπαντᾷ, καὶ ἐν τοῖς διπλασίοις
τοσούτῳ καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἄλλοις ἀνάλογον. συμφωνεῖ δὲ διαπασῶν
καὶ ὁ διπλασίων ἀσιιδς πρὸς τὸν ἡμισυν.

Theo Smyrnaeus devotes a number of paragrapho in his
treatise dc ιιιιιοιόα1 to the ratios which are associated with the
intervals. He gives the ratios of six consonant intervals and
of the Tone and the Semitone or Di'e'sis² (dc mua, c. 12, p. 56„
Hiller), discovered by Pythagoras, by comparing the length
and thickness of strings and their tension, as shown by the
turning of the pega or by hanging weights, and by comparing
the bore of the cavities of wind-instrumenta and the force of
the breath, and the messes and weights of sounding disce and
vessels. It is then shown how the monochord (see above, p.
43) is employed to illustrate the consonant ratios (p. 57,11
Hiller). The string is divided into 4 equal parts, of which 3
give a scund aFourth above that given by the whole string,
2 (the half-string) give the Octave above, and 1 part gives the

¹The αι οιιιιίια is the second of the three sections into which Theon's
aposto rerum matbemctabcrum ad ίιριιιάιιοι Platonem utilium is divided. It
covers pp. 46, ιο-119, fin. in Hillers edition (Teubner, 1878).

'The Pythagoream called the Semitone both λεῖμμα and δίεσις, but the
Aristoxeneans used the latter term for the Quantas-tone cf the enharmonio
ριαυο. cf. Thoonem, loc. cit, p. 55 Hiller.
