two notes are scunded together it is instinctive ιο avoid as
much as possible the roughness produced by rapid beats
between nearly coincident partiale and combinational tcnes,¹

and this results in a tendency ιο make the intervals true-
ι’. a, true ιο those vibration-numbers which will give the
sewest beats or none at all-and sc ιο fix the width cf the
intervals according ιο the simpler ratics, because they give
the best results. Every note in cur modern scale has had its
just intonaticn (not, cf course, its tempered intonaticn) fixed
by these very consideraticnsff'fcr every one cf them is used
cn occasion as part cf a chord. Now in Greek music the
designaticn ‘consonant interval' was limited to the Octave‚
Fiet, and Fcurth, and those intervals which are equal to
one cf these plus one or more Octaves (cf. p. 45). Music was
not ready to take the step by which Thirds and Sixths were
recognized as consonant. As a result, all dissonant intervals,
except possibly those which are derived from the consonances
by subtraction, such as the Major-tone and the Leimrna (cf.
p. 57), were free from any such influence (and it is a powerful
influence)'tending tc fix their size permanently. The conso-
nant intervals may have been tuned (the probabilities are
strong that they were always tuned) by sounding the notes
simultaneously‚ but it is not likely that the Greek dissonances
could have gained anything in exactness of tuning from
sounding the notes together.⁸ It would accordingly not be

aprincipal part in settling the consonant intervals ol' cur musical scales.”

ancient modes in order tc make the harmonio scheme cf asthetics possible.'’

*Ol Plutarch, dc caim. procn, c. 17, 1021 Β (this passage follows closely
on that quoted at p. 54, note ¹, above) : ἐὰν δ’ ὣς ἐννέα πρὸς ὀκτὼ γένηται τῶν
ι βαρῶν ἢ τῶν μηκῶν ἡ ἀνισότης, ποιήσει διάστημα τονιαῖον οὐ σύμφωνον ἀλλ’
ἐμμελὲς ὡς εἷτεῖν ἔμβραχυ, τῷ τοὺς φθόγγους, ἂν ἀνὰ μέρος κρουσθῶσι, παρέχειν
ἡδὺ φωνοῦντος καὶ προσηνές· ἂν δ’ ὁμοῦ, τραχὺ καὶ λυπηρόν· ἐν δὲ τοῖς συμφωνίαις
κᾶν ὁμοῦ κρούωνται κᾶν ἐναλλάξ, ἡδέος προσίεται τὴν συνήχησιν ἡ αἴσθησις.
