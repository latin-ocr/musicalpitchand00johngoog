intervals now called imperfect consonances, although used in
ancient music not only in melody (note after note), but also in
accompaniment or harmony (note against note), were neverthe-
less classed as dissonant.

But there are three intervals which are consonant to so
marked a degree that they are classed as consonant in every
musical system. They are the Octava, the Fisth, and the
Fourth. Inasmuch as all the other intervals which the Greek
treatises recognine as consonant may be derived from these
three primary consonauces, and oonsist of two or more of
them added together,¹ it will be sufficient if we show that the
ratios belonging to these three intervals were discovered by
the ancients, and that this important method of measuring
intervals was successfully employed by them. We shall then
have an absolutely trustworthy means of identifying ancient
intervals with their modern representatives.

Pythagoras, honored by the Greeks ss the discoverer of the
. musical ratios, determined the ratio for· the Octave (διὰ πασῶν)
to be l ε 2, the ratio for the Fisth (διὰ πέντε or δι’ ὀξειῶν) to be
223, and the ratio for the Fourth (διὰ τεσσάρων) to be 3 :45 that
is to say, a string whose length is double that of another sounds
anote an Octave lower, and similarly with the other intervals.
These ratios were undoubtedly obtained by direct observation.
We may suppose the philosopher to have used either a single
string, furnished with a finger-board, or two strings tuned in
unison, or a string furnished with a movable bridge as de·
scribed above (p. 43), the monochord. The lyre is not adopted
to such experiments, but the Egyptians had instrumenta with
very long strings stretched over a finger-board, and Pytha-
goras may easily have been acquainted with these. The ratios

¹ It is true that the Octave is equal to the sum of the Tifth and Fourth,
and all the Greek consonances may thus be said to be composed of Fifths
and Fourths3 but it is better for a number of reasons to regard the Fiith
and the Fourth as parts ci the Octavo, the result cf the first division thereos,
than to regard the latter as the result cf compounding the former.
