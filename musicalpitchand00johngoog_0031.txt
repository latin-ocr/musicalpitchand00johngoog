tice of certain writers of assigning the greater number in a ratio
tothe higher note. K. von Jan distinctly claims a knowledge
of the vibratione of the air for the ancients.¹

The Greek words for pitoh, τάσις and τόνος, are of course
connected with the idea of stretching. It would bc observed
from stringed instrumente that increase in the tension pro-
duced a heightening of the pitch (ἐπίτασις), and that relaxa·
tion produced a lowering (ἄνεσις). Height of pitch or high
pitch is expressed ογ ὀξύτης, the reverse ογ βαρύτης ;, ὀξύς
and βαρύς arethe words for acute aud grave.

A rigorous definition of pitch does not seem to have been
attempted in the ancient works on musical science. It was
usual to define the term either ογ means of ὀξύτης and βαρύ-
της, οι· ογ means of ἐπίτασις and ἄνεσις. In the former
method the idea of height and depth in pitch was assumed
and pitch itself was defined as that which is common to these.
This is the course pursued by Claudius Ptolemy, the Alexan-
drian mathematician, astronomer, and geographer. ,

Ptolemy‚ Harmonice, 1. iv„ p. 8Wallis: ὀ «γὰρ ούτω λεηό-
μενος τόνος κοινὸν ἂν εἴη γένος τῆς ὀξύτητος καὶ τῆς βαρύτη-
τος, παρ’ ἐν εἶδος τὸ τῆς τάσεως εἰλημμένος, ὡς τὸ πέρας τοῦ
τέλους καὶ τῆς ἀρχῆς. As ‘limit' covers both ‘end‘ and
‘beginningss so τόνος both ὀξύτης and βαρύτης.2

In the other method of defining pitoh, the changes in
pitch observed in the tenes of the human voice and in those
of musical instrumente produced the concept of an upward
and downward motion, and pitch was defined as the absence
of such motion, that is, as standing or rest. This is the method
employed ογ Aristoxenus. Τάσις is defined as μονή τις καὶ
στάσις τῆς φωνῆς (Harmonice, Ι. ἓ 31, p. 12 Meib.)‚ or as
ἠρεμία φωνῆς (Ιύίά. 1. ἓ 32, p. 13 Meib.: ἡ δὲ τάσις ὅτι μὲν
οὔτ’ ἐπίτασις οὔτ’ άνεσίς ε’στι παντελῶς δῆλον-τὴν μὲν γὰρ
