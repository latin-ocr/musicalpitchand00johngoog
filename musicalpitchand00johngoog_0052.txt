The question before us is then equivalent to the followingt
Are these linear distanoes commensurable or incommensu-
rable?¹ The answer must here be given without proof,
although its truth is susceptible of mathematical demonstra-
tion. It is that not one of the more usual intervals found in
actual music is commensurable with any other, nor is it possible
to find an interval of any siae that will not be incommensu-
rable with almost every interval which, from its occurrence in
music, we might desire to measure.

Intervals like the Octavo, Fisth, Major-tone, etc, which the
ear recognizes as having a special claim to a name and place
in every musical system, are all incommensurable with one
another. No two distances (on the line cf pitch) corresponding
to intervals of actual occurrence in natural music can be ex-
pressed in terms of a common unit.² Nor can any distance
be discovered, however small or large, which will serve our
purpose with any greater success.

The cause for thia state of affairs is found in the well-known
fact that all intervals are expressible in terms of ratios, which

are derived from physical phenomena. As has been noticed
before (p. 14), pitch depends on the number of vibrations of
the air generated in any period of time by the cause of the
sound. The ratio between the vibration-numbers of two
notes expresses the siae of the interval. Since, now, to com-
pound two ratios it is necessary to multiply them together,

¹Two quantities are commensurable when there is a third quantity which
is contained an exact number of times in each.

’One or two evident exceptione need cause no trouble in accepting tha
essential truth of this doctrine. The Double Oetave and the Double Fifth
(= Octavo -Ι- Major-tone), for example, are obviously twice the siae of the
single Octava and Fifth, respectively. Again, after selecting a unit (for
example, the Tone) nothing can prevent us from commentato intervals cf
twice or any number of times the siae, as the Pythagorean Major-third
(see below, p. 38); but the resulting intervals in this latter case are not
truly musical intervals, but are generally approximatione to natural inter·

vals. Of this more will be said on p. 47.
