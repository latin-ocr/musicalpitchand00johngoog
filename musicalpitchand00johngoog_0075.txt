Still another sericeis given in Plutarch, de euim. proca, c. 19,
1026 Α, to show the division of the Fourth when the Iaeimma
is the middle of the three intervals. It ie:

216 (rone) 243 (mama) aaa (rone) aaa
differencea: 27 13 32

From these figures it is proved that the Leimma is less than
half a Tone, for 13 is less than one-half of either 27 or 32.
The same conclusion is reached at c. 14, 1018 Ε, where we
read: καὶ τῶν ἐμμελῶν διαστημάτων οἱ Πυθαγορικοὶ τὸν τόνον
ἐν τούτῳ τῷ ἀριθμῷ [ι’. e. 27] τάττουσι· διὸ καὶ τὰ τρισκαίδεκα
λεῖμμα καλοῦσιν· ἀπολείπει γὰρ μονάδι τοῦ ἡμίσεος.1
Inasmuch as the Leimma was the lowest of the three inter-
vals into which every Fourth between ‘standing' notee² was
divided to form the ‘high-pitched' variety of the diatonio ραιιιο
(διάτονον σύντονον, or rather διάτονον διτονιαῖον), the numbers
given above³ for this tetrachord can be conveniently used to
give a practical illustrationes the siae of the intervale con·
oerned, because they may be regarded ae representing lengthe
of string.⁴ In this we may imagine ourselves to be repeating

¹The same derivation for the term λεῖμμα (that it isan imperfect or short
Semitonel is given at c. 17, 1020 F (p. 19111 Bernardalrislr λεῖμμα rt ἔλαττον
ὀνομάζουσιν, ὅτι τοῦ ἡμίσεος ἀπολείπεις Gaudentiue,harm. iutrod.,14, p. 16
Μοὶ11. (p. 343 K. v.J.). Other writers seem to derive the term from the
fact that the λεῖμμα is the interval left when two Tones have been taken
from the Fonrth (or three from the Fisth), ae Nicomachus, αιιφῑα, 2, p.
30, eq. Meih. (pp. 267-271 Κ. v. J ., pueaiml: rb καταλειπόμενον λεῖμμα. τὰ
λειπόμενιίεῖσι λθ’ (3953)(13). λείπεται δ ιγ’. καταλειπόμενα ἔσται ιγ’.

(p. 197, τι Rern), quoted above, p. 59, n¹. The following passage bringa ont
the fact that it isin constituting the perfect Fonrth with Tenes that the
λεῖμμα ie needed and on examination turne ont to he a short Half-tone and
so a blemish to the Fonrth: Theo Smyrnaeus, de mua, c. 15, p. 70‚eHiller:
τδ δὲ λεγόμενον λεῖμμα εί τις ἐρωτῴη τίνος ἐστὶ λεῖμμα, δεῖ εἰδέναι δτι ἐστὶ τοῦ

τίνων τελείων.

ὀθόγγιι ἑστῶτες are those notes which keep the same pitch in all three
of the ριιιιτα, the diatonic, chromatio, and enharmonio. They form the
imme-work, as it were, of the scales.
