differs from its neighhors by an interval of either 928 or
256 ε 243, that is, every step is either a Tone or a Leimma.
The scale formed on the binary branch of the tetractys has a
eompass of three Octaves, each Octave containing 5 Tenes and
2 Leimmata. The scale formed on the ternary branchl has a
eompass of three Twelfths, each Twelsth or Dodecachonl being
of the form: nete diezeugmenon-mese—hypate meson-pros·
lambanomenus,² in which the intervals are Fisth, Fourth,
Fisth, and form together au Octave like the Octave of the
binary scale, plue the interval of a Fisth towards the base,
hypate meson-proslambanomenus. Each of the three Do-
decachords, then, contains 8 Tones and 3 Leimmata, when
the scale is completed.

The fact that the eompass of each of these scales is much
larger thau that of any scale described in the musical treatisee
goes far towards showing that they are not to be regarded
as actual musical scales.8 Iu the ternary scale there is the
further objection that each of the three Dodecachords is in a
different key. In other words, the ternary scale pasees into
two new heys
, The question, then, naturally occurs, Are these scales musi-
cal scales at all in the modern sense of the wonl musical? Do
they not rather belong to the music of numbers (ἡ ἐν ἀριθμοῖς
pavorum? The ancient commentatore on the passage them-
selves support this view. It is admitted by AdrastuS, quoted
by Theo Smyrnaeus, de munao, c. 13 (p. 64, sq. Hiller), that
the compass of scales actually used in music falls far short of
that of the longer scale described by Plato, of which the
length is four Octaves and a Major-sixth (= three Twelfths) 3
but it is pointed out that it was necessary to extend the scale
into cubic numbers, because they represent solids.⁴ In any
