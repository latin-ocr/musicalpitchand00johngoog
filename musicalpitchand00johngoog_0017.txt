How different is the state of affairs in the case of the
time-arta, poetry and music! Although it is sels-evident, it is
interesting ιο reflect that these arts, based as they are on a
medium so immaterial as sound, demand a fresh representa-
tion whenever it is desired actually ιο experience any of their
productions; and this is true no less of poetry than of music,
although certain qualifications must be added in the case of
the former. For when we read ιο ourselves, the reproduction
of the sounds is, of course, imagined, and reading music differs
from reading languagc only in that it is an art more difficult
to acquire, and that less satisfactory results are obtained in
the silent reading of music than in that of written worda. It
follows that the fullest appreciation of these time-arta can be
gained only when we are able ιο reproduoe the actual sounds
with at least approximate accuracy.

But poetry stands on an entirely different plane from music
for an evident reason. It is that poetry does not consist of
words alone, however melodicus and rhythmioal, but the
thought is an essential clement in its composition3 and if it
is objected that this is true of music also, it is true in quite a
different sense. Musical sounds are not, individually, like
works, the symbols of thoughts, but the thought in musio
arises from the combination and union of sounds, but is cot
the sounds‚ while in language the thought of a sentence springs
from the combination of lesser thoughts, of which the words
are only the symbols, and for which any other symbola, like
signs with the fingers, could serve almost as well.

For these reasons poetry is in a far better position than
music for perpetuating its productione. To take the case of
Greek poetry, we are able ιο lay down with no little confi-
dence rules for the correct pronunciation of the words, and
for the correct scansion of the metres. But even if by some
means not now available we should learn that all our suppo-
sitione on these points were utterly wrong, we should still
possess the thought, and the thought is imperishable so long as
a knowledge of the language existe. The written word is
