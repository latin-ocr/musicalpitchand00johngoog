that a melody may be said to remain the same. In the one
case we have the familiar phenomenon of a change of lrey 3 in
the other, a change of the ‘tempo' ὁ. a, the speed with which the
musicis performed. In both, the notes bear the sacre rebrtica
to one another as before3 there has been a change in the abso-
lute values alone. But in general it is true that the pitches
and duratione are essential, while the quality and loudness are
accidental, in the formation of melodice. We cannot replace
a note of one pitch by a note of another, nor change the
rhythm by lengthening or shortening notes at pleasure with·
' out affecting the nature and character of the tune.1

¹If now the problern is presented to the student of ancient
music to reprodnoe the sounds of any piece of that music for
which we are so fortunate as to possess the written notes, the
most important points to be determined will be the pitches of

the notes and their differences in duration. We may safely
leave such matters as the right degreea of loudness and sost-

ness‚ and the clement of speed or the tempo to our own teste.
The quality of the tones will depend on the character of the

music, whether vocal or instrumental‚ and if instrumental‚ we
must rely on our knowledge of ancient musical instrumenta.
But the rhythm and the melody (in narrower sense) are matters
of primary importance.

There isa very considerable difference, however, in the
difficulty of determining the exact equivalents for the symbols

¹It is not intended in the above statement to essert that rhythm is in-
dependentes loudness‚ for rhythm is based on the recurrence of aetram at
equal intervals of time. But inasmuch ar, in musicis not in postry‚ that
sound which from its position would ordinarily bear the stress may part
adhibebas in favor of a succeeding note, or may be altapethcr absent, it
would seem that the strecs feature of rhythm was derived from the sequence
of long and short durations ol the notes, τ’. a, from their matre, taken in
connection with the pitch ot the notes (in the case ot music). In other
words, if a tune is played absolutely without stress, the time will manifest
itself in spite of all through the character of the tune. But, be this as it
may, if the reader will exclude stress from the term loudness, tha state-
ment will stand.
