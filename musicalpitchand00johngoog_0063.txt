double geometrical quaternion or tetraetys of the Pytha-
goreans is formed by joining to unity the first three powers
of2and of 3, thus: 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 8, 27. This tetractys may
be arranged so as to exhibit the two branchos consisting of
powers of 2 and 3, respectively, by making a Lambda,¹ as
follows: 1

The left branch contains the duple intervals (διπλάσια δια· .

στήματα) and the right one the triple intervals (τριπλάσια
διαστήματα). Then between the terms of every interval the
harmonical² and the arithmetieal means are inserted. In this
way two series are obtained: 1, t, t, 2, t, 3, 4, λθ, 6, 83
and 1, t, 2, 3, t, 6, 9‚¹÷²‚ 18, 27.
The successiones intervals in the first series, or lest branch,
is t, t,t; t, Μ ; 3, tt ; the suecession in the second series,
or right bramh, is i, Μ i, ἑὼ i, t‚t; that is to say, in
the first series, the second term is t of the first, the third t of
the second, etc. The explanation of these series is held by
commentatore to be that they refer to musical scales. The
ratios t and t will then correspond to the consonances of the
Fisth and the Fourth, their product (fixe = l) to the sum of
these intervals‚ the Octava and their quotient (t -ζ- t = t) to
the difference, the Tone. The last step in the formation of
the scales is that by which every interval of 423 was filled
with intervals of 928 (as many as are contained therein), and
λείμματα, whose terme are as 256 to 243, the intervals of
322 being first resolved (by implication) into intervals of 423
and 928. Seales are therefore formed in which each note

¹The harmonical mean is such that the difference between it and the
leeser extreme is the same part of the latter as the difference between the
greater extreme end the harmonieal mean is of that extreme.
