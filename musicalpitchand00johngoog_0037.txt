the ear learnt to appreciate the intervals and the mind to
retain the simple fragments of tune which resulted.” The
Aristoxenean κίνησις συνεχής (fixed pitoh entirely absent)
would thus seem to characterize the earliest attempts at music,
whereas the κίνησις διαστηματική is peculiar to fully organ-
iaed musio. It would even appear from the last part of the
passage quoted at p. 19(ε’ν δὲ τῷ μελῳδεῖν, etc.) that portamento
was avoided as much as possible by the Greeks in singing,
although it is likely that this phenomenon represents an inter-
mediate stage in the development of musio. We quote again
from Mr. Parry's work on the Art of Musio.¹ “At the very
bottom of the process of development are those savage howls
which have hardly any distinct notes in them at all. Many
travellers record suoh things, and try to represent them in the
European musical stave. For instance, the natives of Aus-
tralia are described hya French traveller as beginning a howl
ona high note and deseending a full ootave in semitones.''
But the author shows that this cannot be an accurate descrip-
tion of the process, “as a downward scale of correct semitones
is beyond the powers of any but very highly trained singers.''
“In all such cases the process must have been a gliding of the
voice up or down, without notes that were strictly defined
either in relation to one another or to any general principle.''

Musioal notes must evidently have first made their appear-
ance when the bounds of such glides assumed a fixed nature
and relationship with each other. The statement in Helm-
holtt² that “ The first fact that we meet with in the musioot'
all nations, so far as is yet known, is that alterations of pitoh
in melodias take place by intervals, andt not by continuous
transit ions,’' isat varianae wrt th the above. It tseems to over·
look the fact that twe ean describe an interval equally well by
gliding tthrough the space as by leaping over it.
