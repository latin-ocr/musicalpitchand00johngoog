tity, when the question of finding a maurae of οιοακυιάυρ differ-
enee of pitch was presented, it would be natural ιο endeavor
to find a ‘smallest possible interval which might serve asa
natural unit.

We have in Plato a reference ιο such attempta. Ι
Plato, Republic,v11.,p. 530 E: ἢ οὐκ οἶσθ’ ὅτι καὶ περὶ

ἁρμονίας ἕτερον τοιοῦτον aaronem τὰς γὰρ ἀκουομένας αὖ
συμφωνίας καὶ φθόγγους ἀλλήλους ἀναμετροῦντες ἀνήνυτα
ὥσπερ οἱ ἀστρονόμοι πονοῦσι. νὴ τοὺς θεοὺς, ἔφη, καὶ γε-
λοίως γε, πυκνώματ’ ἀττα ὀνομάζοντες καὶ παραβάλλοντες τὰ
ὦτα, οἷον ἐκ γειτόνων φωνὴν θηρευόμενοι, οἱ μέν φασιν ἔτι
κατακούειν ἐν μέσῳ τινὰ ἠχὴν καὶ σμικρότατον εἶναι τοῦτο
διάστημα, ᾧ μετρητέον, οἱ δὲ ἀμφισβητοῦντες ὡς ὅμοιον ἤδη
φθεγγομένων, ἀμφότεροι ὦτα τοῦ νοῦ προστησάμενοι. (Quoted
in Theo Smyrnaeus, p. 6 Hiller.)

But it is evident that in dealing with the sensation of pitch
there is the widest range for differences of opinion, and even
if a considerable number of competent persons could agree
that some given interval was the smallest differenoe of pitch
which they could distinguish from unison, there would still
exist the necessity for finding a method of recording the
width of this interval, and this record must necessarily rest
on physical considerations. Thus, in any exact method of
measurement, final appeal will always have ιο be made to the '
intellect. The ear alone cannot be trusted to judge the width
of small dissonant intervals so accuratelyas to enable usto
measure larger intervals in terms of the smaller. When we
consider the difficulty of singing with accuracy the ordinary
chromatic scale, with intervals so large as semitonus, the im·
possibility of obtaining certain results by means of the ear
alone will be apparent.

If, now, the attempt to find by ear a minute interval to
serve as a unit in measuring intervallar size is doomed to
failure, it naturally occurs to inquire if it is possible to select
for the unit one of the intervals found in actual use in music.

Although the number of such intervals (called by the Greeks
