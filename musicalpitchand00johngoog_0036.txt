in the Aristoxenean treatment of pitch changes,1 this form of
movement (which may be described as a continuous movement
modilied by the periods of rest characteristic of discrete move-
ment) was not overlooked, but was notioed only to be passed
over.

Aristoxenus, Herm, 1. ἓ 27, p. 9 Metu: ληπτέον δὲ ἑκάτε-
ρον τούτων (the two forms of motion) κατὰ τὴν αἰσθήσεως
φαντασίαν. πότερον μὲν γὰρ δύνατον ἢ ἀδύνατον φωνὴν
’ κινεῖσθαι καὶ (ἢ Meib.) πάλιν ἵστασθαι αὐτὴν ἐπὶ μιᾶς
τάσεως, ἑτέρας ἐστὶ σκέψεως, καὶ πρὸς τὴν ἐνεστῶσαν
πραγματείαν οὐκ ἀναγκαῖον, τὸ διακινῆσαι (δὲ κινῆσαι libb.)
τούτων ἑκάτερον. ὁποτέρως «γὰρ ἔχει τὸ αὐτὸ ποιεῖ τρίς «γε
τὸ χωρίσαι τὴν ἐμμελῆ κίνησιν τῆς φωνῆς ἀπὸ τῶν ἄλλων
κινήσεων.

But it is not easy to see why continuous motion as a whole
should not be omitted, if that modification of it which admits
periods of rest at fixed pitches is rejected, inasmuch as the
latter is far more musical in its nature than the former.
Without steadiness in the piteh it would be almost impossible
to gain an idea of musical interval, and all musicis based on
interval, or the relation which subsiste between musical notes.
Mr. Hubert Parry saysz² “Just as among the early aueestors
of our species, speech would begin when the indefinite noises
which they first used to communicate with one another, like
animale, passed into some definite sound which conveyed to
the savage ear some definite and constant meaning; so the
indefinite crios and shouts which expressed their feelings
began to pass into music when a few definite notes were made
to take the plaoe of vague irregular shouting.'’ And again,
a little further on: “So the resouroes of music increased as
the relations of more and more definite notes were established,
in obedience to the development of musical instinct, and as
