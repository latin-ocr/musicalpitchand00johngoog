their period. Inasmuch as, if we omit from consideration the
clement of duration in time, sounds differ from one another
in three most prominent particulars,¹ their loudness (force,
intensity), their timbre (quality, Κῑαορ-Εατόε), and their pitch,
any one of these qualities or propertius may be described as
that particular in which a sound varies, if the other two are
kept constant. If, then, the notes of one and the same instru-
ment are sounded with the same degree of loudness, the notes
will differ only in their pitch. Although Helmholtz's dis-
covery that ordinary musical notes are composed of a number
¹ of related pitcheS, cf which one is predcminent‚ is now uni-
versally accepted, and although timbre is thus reduced to a
matter of pitches‚ the threefold division of the character of
musical sounds is still useful. By the pitch cf a note, then,
the prffiominant pitch is generally meant, and since there is
no indication that timbre was analyzed in this way by any of
the ancients, we shall not have to do with any but this, the
nominal pitch of a musical sound.

But it is by no means certain that the existence of the vibra·
tions by which sound is produced was unknown to the Greeks.
The passage from the Aristotelian dc audibilibus, quoted at
p. 7, seems to show that the nature of the motion of the air
was suspected, if not proved. Still more suggestive are the
last words of the following passage:

Aristotle, dc cnimc,118,7 (ρ. 5Κ. v. Jau): ἔστι γὰρ ὁ
ψόφος κίνησις τοῦ δυναμένου κινεῖσθαι τὸν τρόπον τοῦτον
ὅνπερ τὰ άφαλλόμενα ἀπὸ τῶν λείων, ὅταν τις κροόση. οὐ

δὴ πᾶν ὥσπερ εἴρηται ψοφεῖ τυπτόμενον καὶ τόπτον, οἷον

ἐὰν πατάξῃ βελόνη βελόνην· ἀλλὰ δεῖτὸ τυπτόμενον ὁμαλὸν

εἶναι, ὥστε τὸν ἀέρα ἀθροῦν ἀφάλλεσθαι καὶ σείεσθαι.
Furthermore we have Aristotle, Probiana, m. 39 ε ἡ δευ-

τέρα τῆς νεάτης πληγὴ τοῦ ἀέρος ὑπάτη ἐστίν, aud the prac-

¹Eocyclopcdic Britannico, 1. p. 107 b: “Sounds in general exhibit three
differant qualitios, so far as their effect on the aar is concerned‚ via, loud-
neaa, pitch, and timhrcl’
