PREFACE.

The present dissertation, originally submittcd to the authorities
‘ in April, 1895, a now panau in conformia wan aa University
regulations. Ι have thought it best to awail myself of the oppor-
tunity thus offered to make a number of changes and to expand
the treatment in certain directions. Karl von J an's Musici Scrip-
tccca Gracci (Bibliotheca Teubneriana, 1895), which appedred too

late to be of serviae in the original preparation of the thesis, has
been used for the quotations from the Aristotelian Problama and
from the works of Euclid, Nicomachus, Gaudentius, and Bacchius.
Aristoxenus is quoted from the edition of Westphal (Vol. ιι, edited
by F. Satan, Leipsio‚ 1893). The pages of Meihomius, Aatipaac
Musicae Aactcrca Septem Amsterdam, 1652, are, however, retained
in making citations from the authors embraced in this work.
For the musical treatises of Claudius Ptolemy, Porphyry, and
Bryennius the only awailable text was that which is found in the
third volume of John Wallis's Opera Maikenatiane, Oxford‚ 1699.
Ι take pleasure in aoknowledging my great obligation to the
authorities of the Boston Athenaeum for their courtesy in per·
mitting me to consult this rare worlr at leisure in my own home.
I am also indebted for the opportunity aecorded me while in
England in 1894 to use the copies of Wallis and Meihomius
belonging to the Cambridge University Library.
