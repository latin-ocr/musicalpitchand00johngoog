This arithmetical difference varies with the sine of the terme
which compose the ratio, whereas the siae of the ratio is inde-
pendent 101 the size 01 tthe terms used in forming it. For
example, the Fisth rs expressed by any 01 the following 111101,
2: 3, 6. 9, 100. 150, but the difference' 11 now1‚ now3, now
50. But t'here rs this to be said, that whereas the ratios of
1101101 the intervals occurring in music are reducible 10 ratios
whose arithmet ical difference rs 1, or occasionally 2, the ratio
01 the Leimma cannot be reduced to any lower terms than
2432256, and the differenoe will therefore always be either
13 ora multiple 01 13.

Το show how 27 could be regarded as representing the siae
of the Tene, we must turn again 10 the scales in 1111111111
constructed on the double geometrical quaternion. When the
duple and triple intervals which characterize the two branches
are filled up with arithmetical and harmonica] means, the
series obtained involve fractional numbers (see the series given
on p. 48), and when every epitrite ratio (3 :4)is filled up with
epogdoa (8 : 9), as far as possible, leaving Leimmata, the new
terme to be inserted necessitate the use of inconveniently large
numbers in expressing the improper fractione which result.
To avoid 'these fractione, we may follow the example of the
ancient commentatore, and multiply all the terme 01 the series
by the same number, so as 10 obtain whole numbers alone in
which 10 express the ratios. The first four terms of the binary
branch, 1, 1, 1, 2, become 6, 8, 9, 12, when multiplied by the
least· common multiple of the denominators of the fractione.
If now we take the first interval in the series, the ratio 314,
and proceed to insert two intervals of 8 29, we must multiply
the terme of the ratio by 8². This gives 3>< 8² ε 4 >< 8²=
192 : 256, and we have the following series after inserting the
epogdoa: 192 (Tene) 216 (Tone) 243 (Leimma) 206 3 and if we
take the arithmetica] differences, we obtain:
for the Leimma, 256-243=13,
and for the two Tones, 243-216 =27,
and 216-192=24.
