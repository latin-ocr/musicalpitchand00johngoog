, notes¹ Once again, it is possible to show the consonant ratios
from the position of the finger-holos on flutas (οὐλοί).’ The
measurements are made from the mouth-picco downward.

In all of these experimenta for determining the rabios, the
correspondenoe between the ratios and the sensations is com-
plote. In the words of the Peripatetic philosopher, Adrastus
(Theo Smyrn, dc mua„ ο. 13, p. 61,ιο Hiller): τούτοις τοῖς
εἰς τὴν ἀνεύρεσιν τῶν συμφωνιῶν ὀργάνοις κατὰ μὲν τοὺς
λόγους προπαρασκευασθεῑσιν ἡ αἴσθησις ἐπιμαρτυρεῖ, τῃ δὲ
αἰσθήσει προσληφθείσῃ ὁ λόγος ἐφαρμόζει. Noc only do the
consonanoes give the ratios, but the ratios give the consonanoes.

We have just notiood that the quaternion of tho first four
numbers, 1-2-3-4, is mentioned by Theon as containing
all the consonant ratios. He returns to it at chapter 37
(p. 93, ιτ Hiller), where it is called ἡ τῆς δεκάδος τετρακτύς,
because the sum of the four terms is 10. They are, of course,
in arithmetieal progression. Theon next considers the two-
branched quaternion of the Timacus, in which the terms ars
in geometrica] progression, and remarks in the course of his
exposition that the ratios of the consonances are to be found
in these terme.

This double quaternion seems to have been used by the
Pythagoreons to illustrate various musical conceptione. We
now turn to Plutarch's treatise cle caimos procreationem

Timaeo Platonis, o. 30, 1027 F, followed by c. 11, 1017 0,
where the matter is discussed at considerable length.⁸

¹Plutarch falls into this error in an interesting passage in the de animae
ρτοονιαίιοιιι. After giving the ratios of the consonant intervals he says
(o. 17, 1021A): ἔξεστι δὲ καί νῦν βασανίσαι τάληθές, ἢ βιίρη δυεῖν ἄνισα χορδῶν
ἐξαρτήσαντας h δυεῖν ἰσοκοίλων αιἰλῶν τδν ἕτερον μήκει διπλάσιον τοῦ ἑτέρον
ποιήσαντας· τῶν μὲνγὰρ conor δμείζιον βαρύτερον φθέγξεται ὡς ιίπείτη τρδς
νήτην, τῶν δὲ χορδῶνὴ τῷ διπλασίῳ κατατεινομένη βάρει τῆς ἑτέρας ὀξύτερον
ὥς νήτη τρδς ὑπάτην· τοῦτο δ’ ἐστί διδ τασῶν.
