If now we consider the flow of sound prooeeding from any
instrument and rogard only the manner in which change of
pitch takes place, it is plain that the former of the two manners
mentioned above (sudden changes) implies for practieal pur-
poses rest at various stages, that is to say, there will bea
period of fixed pitch before and after each leap.l The second
manner (gradnal changes) implies nothing as to periods of
fixed or stationary pitch. The glides may connect what are
called notes or musical sounds,² or there may be no such notes,
the pitch may never become fixed, but may wander up and
down at random. But when the pitch does remain fixed
before and after a glide, we have the phenomenon of porta-
mento (see above, p. 12), in which the two manners combine.

Returning to Aristoxenus, we find that κίνησις φωνῆς
(briefly, change of pitch) is divided into two kinds of move-
ment, κίνησις συνεχής and κίνησις διαστηματιιιῆ.8 Of these
the former, continuone movement, is that in which not only
are the changes in pitch continuous, bnt there are no periods
of fixed pitch. The latter, dhonne movement (intervallato) is
that in which the pitch leaps over intervals and then rests at
various degrees of pitch.

The passage in which this subject is dealt with runs as
follows:

Aristoxenus Hann„ 1. ἓ 26, p. 8 Meib.: κατὰ μὲν οὖν τῆν
συνεχῆ, τόπον τινὰ διεξιέναι φαίνεται ῆ φωνῆ τῇ αἰσθήσει,
οὕτως ὡς ἃν μηδαμοῦ ἱσταμένη < ᾗ >, μηδ’ ἐπ’ αὐτῶν τῶν
περάτων, κατά «γε τὴν τῆς αἰσθήσεως φαντασίαν, ἀλλὰ φερο-
μένη συνεχῶς μέχρι σιωπῆς. κατὰ δὲ τῆν ἑτέραν, ῆν ὀνομάζο-
μεν διαστηματικῆν, ἐναντίως φαίνεται κινεῖσθαι· διαβαίνουσα

¹We can, of course, conceive of a glide taking place immediately after a
step, bnt such a performance may safely be omitted from consideration.

'See above, p. 11.

'Aristoxenus Hemoniae, 1. ὅ 25, p. 8 Meib.: πάσης δὲ φωνῆς δυναμένης
κινεῖσθαι τὸν εἶρημίναν αι’ντδν τρίπον, δύο τινές εἰσιν ἰδέαι κινήσεως, i) τε συνεχὴς

καὶ ῆ διαστημοτικῆ.
