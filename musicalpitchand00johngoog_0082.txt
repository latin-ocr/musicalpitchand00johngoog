these intervals were tuned witha 101 greater degree 01 accu-
racy than was possible in the case 01 the dissonant intervals.
The consonant intervals at least were fixed in point 01 0100.
Τ1101 10 10 say, we may be sure that all the ancient phil-

osophers who undertook to measure the 0100 01 the διὰ
πασῶν, διὰ πέντε, and the other consonances were measuring
exactly the same magnitudes iu 011 cases, and that these
magnitudes are the same 00 the pitch-differences which we 0011
0010νο, Fifth, etc. But there is no discrepancy in the
reported ratics 101 these intervals. We are not told by one
that the ratio 101 the Octave 10 50 : 100, by another that it 10
50:101. We 010 led to conclude either that the defeots in
the instruments used for the finer measurements were not
serious, or that the ancient theorists were so impressed with
the necessity that the perfect consonances should have the
simpler and more perfect ratios as 10 persist· in ignoring
inconvenieut variatione in the results, even while they dis-
coursed 01 intervals which differed in 0100 by only the tweltth
01 0 Semitone. The first alternative seems preferable. For
11 the Greek monochord was accurate enough 10 allow experi-
menters 10 distinguish between intervals which differed by
only this small amount, then their measurements for the
Fourth, 101 instance, cannot have been wrong by 00 amount
equal to or greater than that (1111010000, unless we suppose
them tc be so dishcnest 00 10 suppress its existence.

It would accordingly seem 10 follow that we must ascribe
the same degree 01 accuracy to the measurements 01 dissonant
intervals as to those 01 the consonauoes, so 101 00 00000100 the
determination 01 their 0100 eyter they 11000 been tuned. Ι1 11
10 reported cn good authority that the 0100 01 0 certain inter-
val is given by a certain ratio, we are not at liberty 10 ignore
this evidence, and no matter how unusual the interval may
seem 10 001 0010 when it is produced mechanically from the
ratic, we must concede that the interval intended by the
ancient theorist cannot have differed appreciably 11001 the
interval thus reproduced.
